# DES1030: 2-D Design 1

* Students develop skills and techniques for 2-D design by using tools, materials and processes common to 2-D design to complete a variety of project activities.
* Prerequisite: [DES1020: The Design Process](DES1020.md)

## Assignment 1 - Logo Design

Your friend is starting a YouTube channel and has asked you to design a logo for it.

* Help brainstorm a name for the channel.
* Create a sketch of how the name could be incorporated into a logo design.
* Design the logo, keeping in mind strategies such as rule of thirds, “S” curve, positive/negative space.
* The final file must on a square canvas (e.g. 800 x 800 pixels), and still look good as a 98 x 98 pixel image.
* You may use any software you prefer, but Adobe Express has some templates you can use.

## Assignment 2 - Banner Design

Now that you have a logo, you need to design a channel art banner including that logo.

* The file must be 2560 x 1440 pixels.
* There must not be any important elements or text outside of the safe area of 1546 x 423 pixels.

## Assignment 3 - Merch

A good YouTube channel should also have merchandise. Choose any *three* of the following to design for your friend's channel:

* t-shirt
* hoodie/sweater
* hat/cap
* toque/beanie
* socks
* water bottle
* tote bag
* sticker

## Assignment 4 - Business Card

To look even more professional, your friend has asked you to design a business card for the channel.

* Include (fake) contact information such as email address, phone number, and the channel link.
* Include the logo and the name of the channel.
* Include your friend's name and title (e.g. CEO or President).
* The finished dimensions should be 1050 x 800 pixels (3.5 x 2 inches).

## Assignment 5 - Job Skills Forms

Complete an [Employability Skills Self-Assessment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeg5oKGSpVoPOOobLzBy20qugNRzDVHIJ4GU4AR6stKZwMFeg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1608836029=DES1012) and a [Personal Inventory Checklist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOEdGul7Omr2ggimeQU-dwUKrWGPU9t52ocposyntKgm7Kjg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1721107223=DES1020).
