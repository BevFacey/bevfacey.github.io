# ELT1140: Robotics Applications

Students apply the fundamentals of robotics systems and basic robotics functions.

* Prerequisite: [ELT1010: Electro-assembly 1](ELT1010.md)

## Safety Reminder

Flying drones involves real risks to people, property, and the drone itself. Always:

* Use a cleared flight area designated by the instructor
* Keep propellers away from hands, people, pets, and objects
* Follow all Canadian regulations for drone flight
* Perform pre-flight checks for battery, GPS lock, and firmware

## Theory

Complete the following tasks using a document, slide deck, video, or other approved medium:

1. Drone Systems
 * Identify the key components of a drone (frame, motors, ESCs, flight controller, sensors, battery, propellers).
 * Explain the role of each component in flight.
2. Sensors and Control
   * Describe how drones use sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, barometer, GPS, optical flow) to maintain stability.
   * Explain the difference between manual input and autonomous stabilization.
3. Open-Loop vs Closed-Loop in Drone Flight
   * Identify which drone systems use open-loop control and which use closed-loop feedback.
   * Provide a simple block diagram showing inputs, controller, outputs, and feedback.
4. Flight Programming Basics
   * Research and explain how flight paths, waypoints, or autonomous missions are programmed in the DJI Neo (or similar platform).
   * Include examples of commands such as takeoff, hover, move forward/back, rotate, and land.
5. Troubleshooting and Safety Protocols
   * Explain common issues in drone flight (signal loss, low battery, sensor errors) and how to safely mitigate them.
   * Summarize pre-flight and post-flight checks.
6. Real-World Applications
   * Identify at least two ways drones are used in industry, agriculture, construction, or research.
   * Explain how understanding drone systems and programming can relate to careers in robotics or electro-technologies.

## Practice

### Simulators

1. Spend at least two class periods flying drones in various simulators:
  * [Pavanandrea Quadcopter Flight Simulator](https://pavanandrea.github.io/QuadcopterFlightSimulator/src/index.html)
  * [FPV Realistic Flight Simulator](https://orqafpv.com/products/skydive)
  * [FlowState](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1209750/FlowState/) ([open source](https://github.com/brucesdad13/FlowState))
  * [LiftOff Drone Simulations](https://www.liftoff-game.com/)
  * [Real Drone Simulator](https://www.realdronesimulator.com/)
  * [Drone Racing League Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/641780/The_Drone_Racing_League_Simulator/)
  * [FPV FreeRider](https://fpv-freerider.itch.io/fpv-freerider) or [FPV Freerider Recharged](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DPmXsjtgC8yY0bEVzklubfN5l4KUsbDo)
2. Perform the following flight drills in the simulator(s) of your choice:
  * take off, fly straight up 2 meters, hold for 10 seconds, then fly straight down to 0.5 meters above the ground
  * fly in a horizontal square pattern
  * fly in a vertical square pattern
  * rotate the drone in place a full 360° in each direction
  * land gently inside a target designated by another student who is acting as your spotter
  * fly a large circle around a designated target
  * fly a Figure-8 pattern
  * fly fast foward, then come to a complete stop and hover over a line without overshooting it
  * run through a series of racing gates
  * (optional advanced) perform a vertical flip, a horizontal roll, and then recover to a stable hover

### Manual Flight 1

1. Prepare the drone and controller.
2. Follow the preflight checklist:
  * observe your surroundings
  * note any obstacles or hazards (for you or the drone)
  * enlist another student to serve as your spotter
  * determine your flight plan
  * ensure that others are aware you are going to launch
2. Fly the drone manually in a designated practice area, performing the following exercises:
   * takeoff and hover for 10 seconds
   * slowly move forward and backward (right stick y-axis), left and right (right stick x-axis), and up and down (left stick y-axis)
   * rotate 90° clockwise and counterclockwise (left stick y-axis)
   * land safely
3. Record some observation notes of your flight and any difficulties encountered.

### Manual Flight 2

1. Prepare the drone and controller.
2. Follow the preflight checklist:
  * observe your surroundings
  * note any obstacles or hazards (for you or the drone)
  * enlist another student to serve as your spotter
  * determine your flight plan in collaboration with your spotter (e.g. around a chair and through a doorway)
  * ensure that others are aware you are going to launch
2. Fly the drone manually in a designated practice area, performing the pre-determined flight plan.
3. Record some observation notes of your flight and any difficulties encountered.

### Autonomous Flight Programming

1. Using the drone’s companion app or programming interface:
 * Create a simple autonomous flight sequence:
 * Takeoff → hover → move along a predefined path → land
 * Include at least 3 waypoints or commands
2. Program one automated behavior using a sensor input, such as:
 * Altitude hold (barometer-based)
 * Obstacle avoidance (if available)
 * Return-to-home trigger (GPS-based)
3. Test your program in a controlled practice space.
4. Document:
 * Your flight plan and/or code screenshot
 * A video or screenshots of the autonomous flight
 * Any issues encountered and how you resolved them
 * Lessons learned about control and robotics principles

## Reflection and Career Connections

Prepare a short document, slide deck, or video including:

1. Comparison of manual vs autonomous flight
2. Safety practices used and why they were important
3. Connection to potential careers in robotics, drone operations, or electro-technologies
