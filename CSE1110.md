# CSE1110: Structured Programming 1

Students are introduced to a general programming environment in which they write simple structured algorithms and programs that input, process and output data, use some of the more basic operators and data types, and follow a sequential flow of control.

1. Introduction to Python
  * Complete the activities in the [Introduction to Python](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcallysto%2Fcurriculum-notebooks&branch=master&subPath=TechnologyStudies/IntroductionToPython/introduction-to-python.ipynb&depth=1) notebook.
  * Copy your Python code for the two *Exercises* into a **document**.
2. Running Python locally
  * Install [Thonny](https://thonny.org) on your computer.
  * Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) 
  * Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the [Python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python).
  * Create a Python file with the code from each of the *Exercises* you completed above. Test them in Thonny and VS Code to make sure they run as expected.
  * Work through [Chapter 20 of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter20), completing the final chapter project if possible. Write a paragraph about what you learned in your **document**.
3. [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
  * Thonny and VS Code are examples of IDEs. In a **document**, describe what each of the following parts of an IDE does:
    1. editor
    1. interpreter or compiler
    1. debugger
    * As well, describe the difference between run-time errors and logic errors.
  * In the same **document**, write about how an IDE is different from a text editor.

Complete an [Employability Skills Self-Assessment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeg5oKGSpVoPOOobLzBy20qugNRzDVHIJ4GU4AR6stKZwMFeg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1608836029=CSE1110) and a [Personal Inventory Checklist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOEdGul7Omr2ggimeQU-dwUKrWGPU9t52ocposyntKgm7Kjg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1721107223=CSE1110).

Check that you have answered everything, and submit your **document**.
