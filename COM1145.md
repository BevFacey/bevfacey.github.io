# COM1145: Animation 1

* Students are introduced to a variety of animation techniques and produce a simple animation; the focus is on basic skills, including planning, keyframing, stage set-up and production, used to create a moving picture.
* Prerequisite: [COM1005: Visual Composition](COM1105.md)

## Assignment 1 - Animation Plan

Plan your animation project:

1. brainstorm ideas to come up with a new story to tell, or an existing story to retell
2. create a [story arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_arc) (beginning, middle, and end)
3. sketch a [storyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard)
    * your story must have at least three scenes each with a different background
    * consider using different "camera angles"
4. think about dialog, sound effects, and music for your project
    * music should be [legal for use](https://creativecommons.org/about/program-areas/arts-culture/arts-culture-resources/legalmusicforvideos/)
5. get your storyboard approved by your teacher before starting the project

## Assignment 2 - Animation Project

Using one of the following programs or websites, or another tool of your choice, create an animation that is between 45 and 120 seconds long. You may use digital drawing or modelling, paper drawings, or stop motion with physical objects.

## Assignment 3 - Project Presentation

1. Show your animation to an audience and ask for feedback.
2. Provide feedback to at least one other student.
3. Write an evaluation of your own work, including:
    1. how the elements and principles of design help facilitate good composition
    2. the technical and creative aspects of the work; e.g., quality, uniqueness
    3. areas of concern/difficulty (if applicable)
    4. the use of tools and equipment
    5. the relationship of the short outline/script to the final product
    6. the quality of completed project
    7. meeting school and community standards; e.g., appropriate language
