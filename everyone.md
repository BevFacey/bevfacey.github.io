* A FaceyComputers laptop computer can be assigned to you for the semester, but may not be taken home except with explicit permission.
  * Use tape to label the lid with your name and period number.
  * Remove any Chrome profiles from former students.
  * Always check that you are using the correct power adaptor.
  * You may install programs or other operating systems if you prefer. Laptops will likely be wiped at the end of the semester.
* You may also choose to connect and use additional monitors.
* At the end of every class period, ensure that your work has been backed up online (e.g. Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, GitHub) in case of local file loss.
