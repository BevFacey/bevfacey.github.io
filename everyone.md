# Facey Computers Activities for Everyone

Day 1 - micro:bit programming

1. Get a micro:bit and a Micro USB cable
2. Ensure the micro:bit (V1) is running [firmware version 0249](https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/firmware/), update it if necessary
3. Create a project at [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org/) that simulates the rolling of 20-sided dice
4. Advanced: with a partner, have each micro:bit roll a number and then display `W` if it rolled the higher number, or `L` if it rolled the lower number. You'll need to use [radio blocks](https://makecode.microbit.org/courses/csintro/radio) for communication
