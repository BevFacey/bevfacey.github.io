# Facey Computers Activities for Everyone

## Day 1 - micro:bit programming

1. Get a micro:bit and a Micro USB cable
2. Ensure the micro:bit (V1) is running [firmware version 0249](https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/firmware/), update it if necessary
3. Create a project at [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org/) that simulates the rolling of 20-sided dice
4. Copy and modify a project from the micro:bit makecode library
5. Advanced: with a partner, have each micro:bit roll a number and then display `W` if it rolled the higher number, or `L` if it rolled the lower number. You'll need to use [radio blocks](https://makecode.microbit.org/courses/csintro/radio) for communication

## Computer Setup
* Your laptop computer will be assigned to you for the semester, but may not be taken home except with explicit permission.
    * Use tape to label the lid with your name and period number.
    * Remove any Chrome profiles from former students.
    * Always check that you are using the correct power adaptor.
    * You may install programs or other operating systems if you prefer. Laptops will likely be wiped at the end of the semester.
    * At the end of every class period, ensure that your work has been backed up online (e.g. Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, GitHub) in case of local file loss.
* You may also choose to connect and use additional monitors.
* IT (CompWorks) students must set up a desktop computer with two monitors.
