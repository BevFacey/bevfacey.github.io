# ELT1080: Control Systems 1

Students construct process control systems, demonstrate their basic operation and demonstrate procedures for testing them. 

## Theory

In a document, slide deck, video, or other (approved) medium:

1. Identify how control systems are used in various residential and commercial applications.
1. Draw and explain a process control system using block diagrams that depict each functional component and the flow of signals.
1. Explain the fundamental differences between open-loop and closed-loop control systems.
1. Define and explain the following process control terms: precision, standard, calibration, accuracy, sensor, transducers, distortion, transients, sampling, interrupt, and frequency.
1. Describe the correct procedures for testing process control circuits for voltage, current, continuity, opens, and shorts.
1. Summarize safe and correct procedures for using both digital and analog meters to measure voltage, current, and resistance.
1. Complete or update a personal inventory (e.g., interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning, and experiences) and explain how this relates to potential future jobs in the electro-technologies field.

## Practice

1. In TinkerCAD circuits, construct a control circuit using passive devices, selecting from: thermistors, pressure sensors, proximity switches, light control resistors, float switches, reed switches, or photocells.
1. Demonstrate how to measure voltage, current, and resistance within a control system using both analog and digital instruments.
