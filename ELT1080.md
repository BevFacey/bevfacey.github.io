# ELT1080: Control Systems 1

Students construct process control systems, demonstrate their basic operation and demonstrate procedures for testing them. 

## Theory

On paper:

1. Explain the fundamental differences between **open-loop** and **closed-loop** systems.
2. Identify at least three real-world examples of control systems in residential or commercial environments.
  * Classify each as open-loop or closed-loop, and briefly explain why.
3. For one of your real-world examples, draw a process control system block diagram, labeling:
  * Inputs (sensors, switches)
  * Processing (controller, logic, comparator)
  * Outputs (actuators, displays, indicators)
  * Feedback path (if closed-loop)
4. Define each of the following as they relate to control systems:
  * precision
  * standard
  * calibration
  * accuracy
  * sensor
  * transducer
  * distortion
  * transients
  * sampling
  * interrupt
  * frequency
5. Describe the correct procedures for testing process control circuits for voltage, current, continuity, opens, and shorts.
6. Summarize safe and correct procedures for using both digital and analog meters to measure voltage, current, and resistance.

## Practice

1. In TinkerCAD circuits, construct a circuit to control an LED or buzzer using one or two passive devices, selecting from:
  * switches
  * flex sensors
  * force sensors
  * photoresistors
  * photodiodes
  * ambient light sensors (phototransistors)
  * pressure sensors
  * PIR (passive infrared) sensors
  * moisture sensors
  * tilt sensors
  * temperature sensors
2. Describe the behavior of the output as the sensor changes state.
3. Draw a block diagram of your circuit (inputs, processing, outputs, and feedback if applicable).
4. Add multimeters to measure voltage, current, and resistance at key points in your circuit.
5. Introduce a simple fault in the circuit (e.g., miswire a sensor or remove a connection). Use measurements to diagnose and correct the fault.
6. Document your process with screenshots and notes.

## Reflection

1. What are one or two other related activities you would like to try?
2. Write a paragraph about how what you learned could relate to possible personal career pathways.
