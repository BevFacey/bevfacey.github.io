# NET2050: Open System Interconnection

Students develop knowledge of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model and its use as a conceptual framework for analyzing network communication tasks. They examine the OSI reference model characteristics, the functions of each of its seven layers and how data moves between layers of the reference model when computers establish a network connection. 

Start with this [lesson on the OSI model](https://networklessons.com/cisco/ccna-routing-switching-icnd1-100-105/introduction-to-the-osi-model).
