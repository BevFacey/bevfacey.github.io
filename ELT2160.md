# ELT2160: Robotics Sensor 1

Students demonstrate how basic sensors are used in a robotic system.

* Prerequisite: [ELT1140: Robotics Applications](ELT1140.md)
 
1. describe the difference between active and passive sensors
    1 describe active and passive sensors and compare when each would be used
2. identify and describe basic sensors used in programmable robotics systems
    1. describe how a basic sensor signal is produced and “read” by the programmable robotics system
    2. identify and describe the uses of the following sensors:
        1. touch
        2. imaging
        3. light
        4. speech
        5. sound
        6. smell
        7. temperature
        8. ultrasonic
        9. rotation
3. verify sensory input conversion, interpretation and reaction in programmable robotics systems
        1. identify programmable robotics system sensor signal input requirements
4. devise a programmable robotics system using at least three sensors to complete a task
        1. develop a design solution including sensor specifications for robotics function to meet design drive criteria
        2. solve a design problem incorporating at least three sensors with a minimum of one active and one passive sensor
        3. construct a programmable robotics system to meet design criteria
        4. program a programmable robotics system to accomplish design criteria

            4. think and solve problems
        2. demonstrate personal management skills to:
            1. demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours
            2. be responsible
            3. be adaptable
            4. learn continuously
            5. work safely
        3. demonstrate teamwork skills to:
            1. work with others
            2. participate in projects and tasks
7. identify possible life roles related to the skills and content of this cluster
