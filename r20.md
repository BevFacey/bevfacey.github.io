# Robotics 20

ELT1140: Robotics Applications

* Students apply the fundamentals of robotics systems and basic robotics functions.
* Prerequisite: ELT1010: Electro-assembly 1

[DES2045: 3-D Design 2](DES2045.md)

* Students continue to develop skills and techniques for 3-D design by using tools, materials and processes common to 3-D design to complete a variety of project activities.
* Prerequisite: DES1040: 3-D Design 1

[ELT2010: Electro-assembly 2](ELT2010.md)

* Students apply electro-assembly technology to manufacture circuit boards.
* Prerequisite: ELT1010: Electro-assembly 1

[CSE1240: Robotics Programming 1](CSE1240.md)

* Students use an appropriate Robot Control Language (RCL) to design, develop, implement and debug robotics programs that employ standard structured programming constructs and simple data structures. In the process, they develop a general understanding of robots and the robotics environment.
* Prerequisite: CSE1110: Structured Programming 1

ELT1910: ELT Project A

* Students develop project design and management skills to extend and enhance competencies and skills in other CTS courses through contexts that are personally relevant.
