# Robotics 20

[ELT2140: Robotics 2](ELT2140.md)

* Students demonstrate the fundamental concepts of sensor devices and control systems by building an electronic circuit to control a direct wire or mobile robot.
* Prerequisite: [ELT1130: Robotics 1](ELT1130.md) OR [ELT1140: Robotics Applications](ELT1140.md)

[ELT2160: Robotics Sensor 1](ELT2160.md)

* Students demonstrate how basic sensors are used in a robotic system.
* Prerequisite: [ELT1140: Robotics Applications](ELT1140.md)

[ELT2010: Electro-assembly 2](ELT2010.md)

* Students apply electro-assembly technology to manufacture circuit boards.
* Prerequisite: [ELT1010: Electro-assembly 1](ELT1010.md)

[ELT2180: Process Control](ELT2180.md)

* Students develop skills in robotics/simulation software control by creating, modifying and using programs that incorporate computer-controlled movements and events in robotics/simulation activities and applications.
* Prerequisite: None

[ELT2080: Control Systems 2](ELT2080.md)

* Students demonstrate how process control technology is used in real-world applications.
* Prerequisite: [ELT1080: Control Systems 1](ELT1080.md)

[CSE1110: Structured Programming 1](CSE1110.md)

* Students are introduced to a general programming environment in which they write simple structured algorithms and programs that input, process and output data, use some of the more basic operators and data types, and follow a sequential flow of control.
* Prerequisite: None

[CSE1240: Robotics Programming 1](CSE1240.md)

* Students use an appropriate Robot Control Language (RCL) to design, develop, implement and debug robotics programs that employ standard structured programming constructs and simple data structures. In the process, they develop a general understanding of robots and the robotics environment.
* Prerequisite: [CSE1110: Structured Programming 1](CSE1110.md)

[ELT2910: ELT Project B](ELT2910.md)

* Students develop project design and management skills to extend and enhance competencies and skills in other CTS courses through contexts that are personally relevant.

[ELT2920: ELT Project C](ELT2920.md)

* Students develop project design and management skills to extend and enhance competencies and skills in other CTS courses through contexts that are personally relevant.
