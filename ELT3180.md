# ELT3180: Robotics Vision Systems

Students examine various types of vision in a programmable robotics system.

* Prerequisite: ELT2170: Robotics Sensor 2

## Theory

1. describe the difference between active and passive vision sensors

    * describe the difference in vision types in robotics systems including:
        * differentiate between active and passive vision
        * describe at least three types of passive vision
        * describe at least three types of active vision

    * describe how each of the following could be used in a robotics vision system:
        * presence or absence of light
        * light intensity
        * night vision capabilities
        * distance away from an object

2. identify and describe how global positioning can be used for vision

    * describe global positioning
    * describe how the following devices are used to track locations:
        * compass sensor
        * motor feedback
        * gyroscopic sensor
    * describe a strategy for using global positioning systems (GPS) for robotics vision where actual GPS is used

3. identify and describe methodologies for object recognition

    * describe how a simulated GPS system can be integrated with visual sensors to allow a robotics system to navigate using:
        * shape
        * colour
        * heat signature

4. identify and describe methods for object avoidance

    * utilize robot footprint requirements to identify and describe object avoidance strategies including:
        * barriers
        * hazards
        * environment

5. create a transitional strategy to accommodate personal changes and build personal values

    * identify short-term and long-term goals
    * identify steps to achieve goals

## Practical

1. design, build and program a passive vision robotics system

    * solve a design problem and build a programmed robotics system incorporating the solution
    * design, build and program a robotics system that uses at least two different passive vision devices to accomplish a specific task; the robotics system must have an interaction between inputs and outputs 

2. design, build and program an active vision robotics system

    * design, build and program a robotics system that uses at least one active vision device to accomplish a specified task; the robotics system must use the active vision device to interact with the environment
