* Prerequisite: [DES2035: 2-D Design 2](DES2035.md)

DES3045: 3-D Design 3

* Students apply theories, skills and techniques appropriate to 3-D design. Students will deal with such aspects as shaping, massing, proportion, scale, contrast, colour, texture and finish within the context of complex 3-D design projects. Students are introduced to cultural, symbolic and human factors, principles and ergonomic considerations.
* Prerequisite: [DES2045: 3-D Design 2](DES2045.md)

[DES3145: Modelling – Real](DES3145.md)
