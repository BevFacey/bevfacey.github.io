  <h3>Project 1: Learning the Alphanumeric and Symbol Keys</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6>Right-hand Home Row and Shift Keys</h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../images/inf2020_010_l.jpg" alt="A keyboard with the following keys highlighted: J, K, L, ;, left shift, and right shift." width="633" height="187" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This lesson  introduces you to the J, K, L, and semicolon keys as well as the Shift keys.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_tricks_l.jpg" alt="tip" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p> For all of the other  keys that you will be learning, it is strongly suggested that you practise  moving your finger from home row to the new key and back to home row several  times while watching your finger make the move. Pay special attention to the  distance and the direction your finger has to travel to get to the intended  key. Allow your brain and the muscles in your hands to “memorize” this distance  and direction because later on you won’t be looking at the keys while you are practising.  As you type, envision the path your fingers make and say each letter to  yourself as you strike it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../images/single_keys_l/shift_l.jpg" alt="A shift key." width="147" height="60" /><br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right1blockColour">
    <p><strong>Shift  key: </strong>one of several service keys that makes uppercase  letters and allows characters from the top row to be typed    </p>
  </div>
  <p>Now that you’ve learned the eight letters of  home row, you’ll learn to use the <strong>Shift  keys</strong> to make capital letters. Capital letters are called uppercase letters.  Small letters are called lowercase letters.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The little  finger on each hand is used to operate either Shift key. The <span class="nowrap">right-hand</span> Shift  key is used if you want to capitalize a letter typed with the left hand. The  left-hand Shift key is used if you want to capitalize a letter typed with the  right hand.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For example,  if you want to type a capital A, you will anchor on the J key (keep the J  finger at home), make an extended reach to the right and downward to the  right-hand Shift key, and press the A key with the little finger on your left  hand. If you want a capital K, anchor on the F key, make an extended reach to  the left and downward to the <span class="nowrap">left-hand</span> Shift key with the little finger on the left hand and hit the K key  with the middle finger on your right hand.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Making  capital letters involves the use of two keys, so it might take a bit more  practice to use them proficiently. To make a capital letter, you must remember  to hold the shift key down long enough for the letter key to be struck.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Follow through Practice 1 to practise using the home  row keys through to the shift keys.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="show_btn"><strong>Practice 1</strong></div>
<div class="contentparent_box">
      <div>
        <p><strong>Left-hand Home Row</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <span class="typewriter">fff ddd sss aaa fff ddd sss aaa fff ddd sss aaa </span>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Right-hand Home Row</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="typewriter">jjj kkk lll ;;; jjj kkk lll ;;; jjj kkk lll ;;;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Remember to  keep your hands on home row, tap the <strong>space  bar</strong> with your right thumb, and try to memorize the keys and their  locations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Home Row Together</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="typewriter">aaa ;;; sss lll ddd  kkk fff jjj aaa ;;; sss lll ddd kkk fff jjj<br />
          fff aaa ddd fad fad  aaa sss kkk ask lll sss all sad<br />
          aaa ddd lad ddd add  sss aaa ;;; as; as; alas ddd dad <br />
          fad sad lad dad ask  as; fall alas flask lass falls</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Keep working  on the home row until you can type any of these combinations without looking at  your hands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Adding Capital Letters with Shift</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When you are  typing capital letters, always hit the <strong>Shift</strong> key with the opposite hand. For example, if you want a capital A and are typing  it with your left hand, you must press the <strong>Shift</strong> key with the right pinky finger. This is tricky, so make sure you spend some  time practising.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="typewriter">aAa sSs dDd fFf jJj  kKk lLl ;:;</p>
        <p class="typewriter">Sad Fad Dad Lad Lass Flask Alaska KKK JJJ</p>
        <p class="typewriter">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
  </div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To type in  all capital letters (uppercase) without having to hold the Shift key down,  press the Caps Lock key once. Only letters will be capitalized. This key does  not affect number and symbol keys. Pressing the Caps Lock key a second time  will turn off the capitalization function.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right1blockColour">
    <p><strong>service  key: </strong>any key that does not type a character </p>
  </div>
  <p>So far, you have learned to touch type with the left  and right home row keys, the space bar, and some of the <strong>service keys</strong>, namely the Backspace, Shift, and Caps Lock keys. Now  it’s time to reach out for some of the other keys, both above and below home  row. As before, when you learned to use the Backspace and Shift keys, make sure  you anchor on home row while you reach out for keys that are not on home row.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6>Reaching Other Keys from the Home-Row Position</h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../images/inf2020_011_l.jpg" alt="An image of a keyboard shows highlighted E, T, I, N, and period keys." width="633" height="187" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/single_keys_l/e_l.jpg" alt="an illustration showing the E key" width="60" height="60" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>The E Key</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The E key is  struck with the D finger. It is a natural reach up from the D key to the E key.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Watch your finger make the move to the E key several  times, and memorize the distance and direction your D finger has to travel to  reach the E key. Use the A finger or the F finger as an anchor so that you can  return to home row easily.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/single_keys_l/i_l.jpg" alt="an illustration showing the I key" width="60" height="60" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>The I Key</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The I key is struck with the middle finger of  the right hand. The I key is a natural reach up from the K key. Watch your  finger make this path a few times, and memorize the distance and direction your  finger has to travel from the K key to get to the I key.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Remember to keep one finger on or hovering just  above home row so that you can always come back to home base. Either the semi  finger or the J finger is the best anchor for the reach to the I key. Try each  one to see which is most comfortable for you.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/single_keys_l/t_l.jpg" alt="an illustration showing the I key" width="60" height="60" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>The T Key</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The T key is  struck with the F finger. This is not a natural reach. To get to the T key, your  F finger has to extend upward and to the right. Again, trace out this distance  and direction, and memorize it with both your brain and your hand muscles  before doing the practice exercises. The A finger serves as a good anchor for  the reach to the T key.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_safetip_l.jpg" alt="safety tip" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Remember to take regular  breaks from typing!<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/single_keys_l/period_l.jpg" alt="an illustration showing the period key" width="60" height="60" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>The Period  Key</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You are now going to learn the first punctuation  key that is not on home row. The period key is struck with a natural downward  reach with the L finger. Anchor on the J key. A period at the end of a sentence  is followed by one space (strike the space bar once with your right thumb).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/single_keys_l/n_l.jpg" alt="an illustration showing the period key" width="60" height="60" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>The N Key</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The N key is  struck with the J finger. This is an unnatural reach because the J finger has  to move downward and to the left. Leave at least one finger on home row as an  anchor.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Follow through Practice 2 to practise the E, I T, N,  and period keys just covered. Take time to review previously covered keys as  well.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="show_btn"><strong>Practice 2</strong></div>
  <div class="contentparent_box">
    <div>
      <p><strong>E, I, T, Period, and N</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The E key  uses the D finger (middle) on your left hand. It is a natural reach up.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="typewriter">ddd ded eee ddd ded  eee ddd ded eee she ded led ded he; sees; she led; he led;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The I key  uses the K finger (middle) on your right hand. It is a natural reach up.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="typewriter">kkk kik iii kkk kik  iii lid kik if is; Id Sid disk kid said</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The T key  uses the F finger (index) on the left hand.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="typewriter">fff ttt fff ftf ftf  ttt fff tft ftf ttt fff kit ate tie it is at</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When typing a period, use the L finger (ring) on your  right hand. Space once after a period at the end of a sentence, and space once  after a period following an abbreviation. Space once after a semicolon.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="typewriter">lll l.l … lll l.l  ea. St. std. Id.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The N key  uses the J finger (index) on the right hand.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="typewriter">jjj nnn jjj nnn jnj jnj nnj nnj ten and net</p>
