  <h3>Project 1: Learning the Alphanumeric and Symbol Keys</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Why Learn to Keyboard?</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Computers  have become necessities in many parts of people’s lives—at work, at school, and  at home. People have computers in their offices, homes, and vehicles. They use  many types of mobile devices, like laptops,  BlackBerry products, and other PDA devices  while on the go. Businesspeople often carry a computer with them to meetings  and to do work while travelling. Farmers use computers to keep track of farming  activities and to maintain their accounting systems. Students use computers to  access information on the Internet for school assignments, complete online  coursework, and keep in touch with friends. People  use spreadsheets or accounting software to manage their finances. Businesses  use computers for a multitude of purposes.</p>

    <p><strong>keyboarding: </strong>a term synonymous with touch typing</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>touch typing:</strong> typing without having to look at the  keys</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>QWERTY:</strong> a keyboard having the standard arrangement of keys on  the alphanumeric keypad; the first six letters in the third row</p>
  </div>
  <p>The efficient use of a computer involves knowing the  functions of the computer and the software package you are using as well as  knowing the keyboard—knowing how to type without looking at the keys. <strong>Keyboarding</strong>, also known as <strong>touch typing</strong>, reduces inputting time  while decreasing the stress involved in computer use. Touch typing also reduces  physical stress on the body while inputting data.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Each level of Keyboarding will teach you how to  type on the <strong>QWERTY</strong> (standard)  keyboard using alpha (alphabet), numeric (numbers), and symbol keys as well as  the numeric keypad.<br />

The keyboard is divided into separate keypads, or groups of keys, that serve a particular function. As you work through the course, you’ll become proficient in the use of both the alphanumeric keypad and the numeric keypad." width="445" height="225" /></p>
