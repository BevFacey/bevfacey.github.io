  <h3>Project 1: Learning the Alphanumeric and Symbol Keys</h3>

  <p>While Rikea  enjoyed her piano lessons, she didn’t always enjoy the many hours of practice  that were required. There was always room for improvement in speed, rhythm,  accuracy, and technique on the piano keyboard. However, Rikea had  determination. Today she is an accomplished concert pianist.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Like Rikea,  you’ll gain proficiency on a keyboard that will serve you well for the rest of  your life. Keyboarding will introduce you to the alphanumeric keys, service  keys, and punctuation keys, as well as to the numeric keypad. It is the goal of  this section to get you touch typing at a speed of 30–50 words per minute on the alphanumeric  keypad, with no more than one uncorrected error, and 100–150 keystrokes per minute  on the numeric keypad on four one- to four-digit numbers, with no more than one  uncorrected error. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If it seems  you are not doing as well as you would like, don’t give up. Persevere. If you do  a little each day, you’ll eventually reach the goal you desire, just like  Rikea.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this project you will learn about properly  setting up your computer workstation. You will read about ergonomics, and you  will be given tips and shown images and video demonstrations to help you set up  a proper workstation. You will be introduced to the alphanumeric keys on the  alphanumeric keypad. You will learn their reaches and practise the correct  finger to use  on those keys. You will also be introduced to punctuation  keys—such as commas and periods—and some service keys—such as Enter, Delete, and  Backspace. When you are familiar with the keys and the reaches, you will take  some time to practise the keys. When you feel ready, you will perform some  timed writings with your teacher observing. You will then discuss your results in  comparison to performance standards. Your teacher will give you  guidance, help you determine your speed and accuracy, and  give you feedback  on your typing technique.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Project Assessment(s)</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_assesment_l.jpg" alt="assessment" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> In this project, you will be assessed in these areas:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>touch typing  skills—completing a number of exercises and timed writing tests</li>
    <li>touch typing  technique—addressed through workstation routines and the completion of a technique  assessment</li>
    <li>basic competencies developed in your learning of the  alphanumeric keypad</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Skill Level</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Keyboarding your goal is to touch type at a speed of between  30–50 words per minute on the alphanumeric keypad and 100–150 keys per minute  on the numeric keypad, with no more than one uncorrected error. The lengths of  timings for this section are two and three minutes. Check the assessment  documents to see where your skill level falls.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Estimated Required  Time </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In order to properly develop your touch typing skills on the alphanumeric  keypad and the numeric keypad, you should commit to daily learning and  memorization of the keys. You may need to spend some time practising the key  locations and doing practice timed tests until you feel confident that your  skill level matches the assessment requirements of this course. Most of the  time you will spend in this course will be practice time. This project will  take you somewhere between 10 and 15 hours, which includes covering course  material, practising, completing exercises and self-checks, and communicating  with your teacher. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Environmental Impact</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  To save on electricity, make sure you turn off your  computer and everything on your workstation when you are finished practising.
