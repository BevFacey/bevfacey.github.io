  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>The Exclamation Mark (!) Key</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>An  exclamation mark is used to end a sentence that shows an exclamation or  expression of surprise. It’s followed by one space.<br />
      <br />
    </dt>
    <dd>Example: She outran everyone in her class! Second place was 10 seconds behind  her.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>The exclamation mark is typed by anchoring on the F  key, holding down the right Shift key with the semi finger, and making an  extended upward and outward reach to the left with the A finger to the second  row above home row on the number 1.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv130x63"><img src="../images/single_keys_l/nine_l.jpg" alt="an illustration showing the parentheses keys" width="60" height="60" /> <img src="../images/single_keys_l/zero_l.jpg" alt="an illustration showing the parentheses keys" width="60" height="60" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>The Parenthesis Keys</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Parentheses  are used to add or set off a piece of text within a body of text. The left parenthesis  comes directly in front of the text; the right parenthesis comes directly after  the text. The left parenthesis does not have a space after it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The left  parenthesis key is struck while holding down the left Shift key, anchoring on  the J key, and making an extended natural reach with the L finger to the 9 key  in the top row. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The right  parenthesis key is struck while holding down the left Shift key, anchoring on  the J key, and making an extended natural reach with the semi finger to the 0  key in the top row.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>The right  parenthesis is used to end the text that follows the left parenthesis. It is  not preceded by a space, but it is followed with one space if more text follows  it. If the right parenthesis ends the statement, it is followed immediately by  the ending punctuation mark. If the end punctuation mark comes before the right  parenthesis, the parenthesis is followed by one space.<br />
      <br />
    </dt>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;	</dt>
    <dd>Example: The first-quarter report (January, February, and March) shows a net profit  of $520 000.<br />
      Sylvia  won the highest academic achievement trophy (which everyone expected would  happen).</dd>
  </dl>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/single_keys_l/hyphen_l.jpg" alt="an illustration showing the hyphen key" width="60" height="60" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>The Hyphen (-) Key</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The hyphen  key is struck by making an unnatural upward reach to the top row of keys with  the semi finger. The semi finger has to travel directly upward, not following  its natural direction.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The hyphen key is used to make a dash by striking the  hyphen key twice and putting no spaces before, after, or between the hyphens.  In many word-processing programs, the two hyphens will be converted to a dash automatically  after the space bar is struck or after an end punctuation mark is typed. A dash  has no space before or after it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv130x63"><img src="../images/single_keys_l/enter_l.jpg" alt="an illustration showing the enter key" width="136" height="60" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Enter Key</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Enter key allows you to put a hard stop at  the end of a line and move the cursor to a new line. It is also used to put  extra spaces between sections of text. This key is a large key located at the  far right side of the alphanumeric keypad, on the same row as home row. It is  reached by anchoring on the J key and extending the semi finger as far to the  right as you can reach.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/single_keys_l/tab_l.jpg" alt="an illustration showing the tab key" width="99" height="60" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Tab Key</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Tab key  (also known as the tabulator) is struck by using the A finger to make an upward  and left-outward reach to the first row above home row. Trace out this distance  and direction several times. The word-processing software you are using has  preset tab (default tab) stops every five spaces. If you press the Tab key  repeatedly, your cursor will jump across the screen five spaces at a time  (unless you have changed the tab settings).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A tab is used  to separate text into columns or to indent new paragraphs.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Follow through Practice 8 to practise the  exclamation mark, left and right parentheses, hyphen, Enter, and Tab keys just  covered. Take time to review previously covered keys as well.</p>

      <div>
        <p>The  exclamation mark is found on the number 1 key, above the Q key. It is an  extended reach with the pinky finger on your left hand. Remember to press the <strong>Shift</strong> key with your right hand when you  press the number <strong>1</strong> key.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="typewriter">111 !!! 11! !!1 She  outran everyone in her class! The second place winner came in 10 seconds after  her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Left and  right parentheses, ( ), are found on the 9 key and the 0 key—above the O and P  keys. When typing a left or right parenthesis, you must shift with your left  hand and press the correct parenthesis.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="typewriter"><br />
        The first quarter  report (January, February, and March) shows a net profit of $520,000.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The hyphen  (-) is also found two rows above home row, to the right of the 0 number key.  This key does not need a shift with your left hand. Use the pinky finger on your  right hand to type a hyphen.</p>

        <p>The Enter key  uses the semicolon finger on your right hand. It is used to move the cursor to  the next line to start a new paragraph or to create a column or list.</p>

  <p>You have all the information you need to be on  your way to  proficiency in touch typing. Now you need to practise. As in  Rikea’s example, you need constant and regular practice to develop your  instinct to keyboard without looking at your hands. Take the time to learn  every key and its reach, and memorize that reach so that you can type whatever  text is given to you blindfolded.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Continue to practise the keys already covered. Remember, you are only  mastering the alphanumeric keypad right now— the numeric keypad is to come.</p>
