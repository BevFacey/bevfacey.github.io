  <h3>Project 1: Learning the Alphanumeric and Symbol Keys</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Proofreading and Error Count</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The practices  and exercises you complete will encourage you to make corrections to your work.  If your teacher sees the types of errors you make, he or she can make  recommendations as to how to correct specific types of errors. In most  exercises, you’re expected to proofread the work you type, print your work, and  circle errors that were not corrected while you were typing.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>An incorrect  word is counted as one error, no matter how many errors are in it. A word  includes the space and punctuation after it. When recording your error count,  count all errors and indicate that number. The number of errors is not divided  by the length of the timing. This indicates the total number of errors, not the  errors per minute.</p>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <h5>Rules for Finding Errors</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Following are eight rules for finding errors, each  followed by an example illustrating the error. The first line in each example  is correct. Compare it with the second line, and note the errors that have been  highlighted.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Rule 1: </strong>Any misstroke is an error.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Example</strong><br />
        <br />
    </dt>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dd class="typewriter">She fed us egg  salads and Ed fed us turkey.<br />
      She  fed <span class="typewriterhighlight">os</span> egg salads and Ed  fed <span class="typewriterhighlight">os</span> turkey<span class="typewriterhighlight">,</span> </dd>
  </dl>
  <p><strong>Rule 2: </strong>Never count more than one error per  word. Even if a word has many errors in it, only one error is counted.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Example</strong></dt>
    <dd><br />
    </dd>
    <dd class="typewriter">Dad and I aim to  tame the doe.<br />
      Dad <span class="typewriterhighlight">mad</span> I aim to <span class="typewriterhighlight">tnae</span> the <span class="typewriterhighlight">deu</span>.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p><strong>Rule 3: </strong>The spacing and punctuation after a word  are a part of that word. An error in spacing or in punctuation is counted as an  error in that word. </p>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Example</strong><br />
        <br />
    </dt>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dd class="typewriter">You see, he fell; he  got hurt.<br />
      You see<span class="typewriterhighlight">.</span> he fell, he <span class="typewriterhighlight">goth</span>urt.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p><strong>Rule 4:</strong> Each word left out of the text is  counted as an error.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Example</strong><br />
        <br />
    </dt>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
    <dd class="typewriter">I guess Lisa is  here; Jeff said she is.<br />
      I guess Lisa<span class="typewriterhilite">&nbsp;</span><span class="typewriterhighlight">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> here; Jeff  said she is.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p><strong>Rule 5:</strong> A repeated word is counted as an error. </p>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Example </strong><br />
        <br />
    </dt>
    <dd class="typewriter">I expect to sell six  tickets for the play.<br />
      I expect to sell six  tickets for the <span class="typewriterhighlight">the</span> play.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p><strong>Rule 6:</strong> A transposition (typing words or letters  in the wrong order) counts as one error. </p>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Examples</strong><br />
        <br />
    </dt>
    <dd class="typewriter">Please pick up some  wax paper.<br />
      Please pick <span class="typewriterhighlight">some up</span> wax paper.<br />
      <br />
      I guess Lisa is  here; Jeff said she is.<br />
      I guess Lisa is  here; Jeff s<span class="typewriterhighlight">ia</span>d she is.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p><strong>Rule 7:</strong> A word that is not properly indented or  aligned counts as one error. </p>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Example</strong><br />
        <br />
    </dt>
    <dd class="typewriter">We gave half to him  and half to her.<br />
      &nbsp;<span class="typewriterhighlight">We</span> gave half to him and half to her.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p><strong>Rule 8:</strong> If there is an error in line spacing, it  counts as an error with the sentence immediately preceding it. </p>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Example<br />
          <br />
    </strong></dt>
    <dd class="typewriter">We took John a small  gift.<br />
      He told us he liked  it.<br />
      I liked it also.<br />
      <br />
      <span class="typewriterhighlight">We took John a small gift.</span><br />
      <br />
      He told us he liked  it.<br />
      I  liked it also.</dd>
  </dl>
