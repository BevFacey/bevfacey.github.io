  <h3>Project 1: Learning the Alphanumeric and Symbol Keys</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Training Room 1: Calculating Your Speed</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Counting Words per Minute (WPM)</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In  keyboarding a “word” consists of five keystrokes. A keystroke is any letter,  number, or symbol key you strike, as well as the space bar and Enter key.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To calculate  your speed per minute, count the number of total keystrokes used and divide by  5 to find the number of total words typed. Then divide the total word count by  the number of minutes you were typing. If your word processing software has a  word count, then this process is easy. If, for example, you typed for a total  of 2 minutes and typed 250 keystrokes, you would first divide 250 by 5 for a  total of 50 words. Then, since you typed for 2 minutes, you would divide 50 by  2 to get 25 words per minute.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For most of the exercises in this course, each line  will have a number to the right of the line. This number shows how many words  are in the line, saving you from having to do the calculations to find the  number of words in the line. Along the bottom of the text, there are number  grids showing the word count for each line. If you do not complete a line of  typing, you can use the numbers along the bottom of the text to find the number  of words in the partial line.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6>Example</h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="left3block"><span class="typewriter">The  wind picked the leaf from the tree,</span></div>
  <div class="left1block"><strong>8</strong></div>
  <p><br />
  </p>
  <div class="left3block"><span class="typewriter">and carried it through the air,  ever so</span></div>
  <div class="left1block"><strong>16</strong></div>
  <p><br />
  </p>
  <div class="left3block"><span class="typewriter">effortlessly. The leaf knew it was  now</span></div>
  <div class="left1block"><strong>24</strong></div>
  <p><br />
  </p>
  <div class="left3block"><span class="typewriter">free to go anywhere it chose.</span></div>
  <div class="left1block"><strong>30</strong></div>
  <p><br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="typewriter"><strong>....1....2....3....4....5....6....7....8</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are a total of 30 words in this passage. If you  typed as far as the word <em>go</em> in the last  sentence, you would have typed 24 words plus another 2 words from the partial line  for a total of 26 words. If you typed this in 1 minute, your speed would be 26  words per minute, or 26 wpm. If you typed it in 2 minutes, your speed would be <span class="nowrap">26 ÷ 2 = 13 wpm.</span> If you typed the first two lines in 1 minute, your speed would  be 16 wpm.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/inf2020_018_l.jpg" alt="An illustration of a male student saying, “Oh! I get it! To get my word count, I take the last completed line I typed and look at the number shown in the word count on the right. Then I add the word count for the partial line using the grid at the bottom.” " width="445" height="225" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_clock_l.jpg" alt="clock timing" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>Take a minute to try typing the previous example using a timing  device (timer) or have a friend or family member time you. Don't worry about  your errors at this time. Remember to use Courier font and to hit the <strong>Enter</strong> key at the end of each line so  that your text looks like the passage you are typing. Remember, the goal of  this course is to reach a minimum speed of 30 wpm. How did you do?<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When  calculating your speed on the numeric keypad, your speed will be recorded in  keystrokes per minute (kpm) rather than in words per minute (wpm). If you struck  120 keys in 1 minute, record your speed as 120 kpm. If you struck 120 keys in 2  minutes, record your speed as 120 ÷ 2 = 60 kpm.</p>
