  <h4>Workstation Security</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Protect Your Hardware</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Computer  equipment is expensive and sensitive. Computer hardware includes your computer  and peripherals (e.g., printer, mouse, keyboard, and monitor). All these pieces  of equipment are considered part of your workstation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6>Powering  the Computer</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Use  a surge protector power bar to safeguard your computer against power surges, which can damage your CPU (central processing unit).<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>At  all times, avoid plugging or unplugging any device into the CPU box while the  computer is on.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Power  up (turn on) your peripherals before turning on the CPU. This informs the computer that peripherals  are attached.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Turn  the monitor off if you are not going to use it for several hours, unless you  have a model that goes into sleep mode (turns itself off and comes back on when  the mouse is moved or a key is hit). You can also run a screensaver program to  reduce the wear on the monitor.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Before  shutting down your computer, exit all programs you have open; then exit  Windows. Finally, turn off the power bar. Computer technicians often recommend  that users shut down their equipment at the end of the day or week. Shutting  down frequently during the day can be hard on your computer.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>Equipment  Maintenance</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Set  up your computer in a clean environment. Dust your monitor regularly with a  soft cloth. Disconnect your computer and peripherals from the power source  before moving them to a different location.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Ensure  there is good air circulation around your computer to prevent overheating, and  avoid placing heavy objects on top of your computer.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Protect Your Software</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Licensed software can be very  expensive, sometimes costing hundreds of dollars. It is important to protect software  from damage and secure it from unauthorized use. Most software is copyright  protected, which means sharing or copying software without written consent of  the copyright holder is illegal.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6>Security  and Authorization</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Register  the software according to the manufacturer’s directions for the number and  location of users. Some licences are for one computer station only; others are  for multiple workstations.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Store  the manuals and software discs together in a place where they can be easily  accessed and are secure from unauthorized users.</li>
  </ul>
  <h6>Maintenance</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Store  DVDs and CDs in protective holders to avoid damage, such as scratching,  marking, cracking, and breaking.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Handle  discs on the edges and avoid fingerprints on the disc surface.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Don’t  write on the discs.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Avoid  using liquid for cleaning purposes, as a single drop of water can affect the  laser beams ability to read the disc.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Extreme  heat and cold and magnetic sources can cause severe damage to discs.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>You  can clean and repair scratched discs with kits available from most electronics  stores.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Protect Your Personal Work</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The work you  produce on a computer becomes “priceless” once you have invested time, energy,  and ideas.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Save  your files with a name that makes sense. Limit the number of characters used.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Store  your files in folders that group related files together.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Save  your documents often and after every major change you make to your file.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Back  up your files to a flash drive or a network drive, if you have one.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>If  you work on a computer or network that is used by other people, create a  personal folder in which to store your work.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Delete obsolete files that are no longer useful.</li>
  </ul>
