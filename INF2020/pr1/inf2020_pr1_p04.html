  <h3>Project 1: Learning the Alphanumeric and Symbol Keys</h3>
  <p><br />
  </p>
  <h4>How to Do It</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Keystroking</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Proper  keystroking is very important. If you hold any of the keys down, the character  you are typing repeats itself. That’s why the keys must be struck with a quick,  sharp tap—just enough to cause the key to begin its movement. Don’t strike the  keys too hard—it’s not necessary to use a great deal of force. The only way to  learn how to strike the keys is through feel and practice.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Alpha Keys and Symbol Keys</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6>Home Row</h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../images/inf2020_008_l.jpg" alt="An illustration of a keyboard with highlighted home row keys: A, S, D, and F for the left hand; J, K, L, and semicolon for the right hand; and the space bar." width="633" height="187" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right2blockColour">
    <p><strong>home  row: </strong>eight keys (A, S, D, F, J, K, L, and  ;) located in the centre row of the alphanumeric keypad; the base or home from  which all other keys are reached</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>anchoring: </strong>keeping at least one finger touching  or raised slightly above its position in home row so that the fingers do not  lose their proper keyboarding position</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>alpha  character:</strong> an alphabetical letter key on a  keyboard</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>alphanumeric keypad: </strong>the keypad used for typing text; has keys for all of  the letters of the alphabet and punctuation keys</p>
  </div>
  <p>The set of  eight keys from which you will reach all the other keys on the alphanumeric  keypad is called <strong>home row</strong>. The home  row for the left hand comprises  the A, S, D, and F keys. For the right  hand, the home row comprises the J, K, L, and ; (semicolon) keys. You should  keep at least one finger on, or hovering just above, the home row at all times  so that on extended reaches you’ll be able to come back to home base and get  the direction for other keys. This is known as <strong>anchoring</strong>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Home row is the base from which all other keys are  reached; for this reason you will learn these keys first. Home row consists of  eight keys located on the second row of <strong>alpha  characters</strong> on the <strong>alphanumeric  keypad</strong>. Your left hand controls the A, S, D, and F keys; and your right  hand controls the J, K, L, and ; (semicolon) keys.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The fingers  used to strike the home-row keys take the names of the keys: A finger, S  finger, D finger, F finger, J finger, K finger, L finger, and semi (short for  the word <em>semicolon</em>)  finger.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is a small line or dot that is raised on either  the D and K keys (Macintosh) or the F and J keys (all other keyboards). These marks allow you to feel the position  of your fingers and know that they are on the correct keys without having to  look at them.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6>Left-hand Home Row, Space Bar, and Backspace Key</h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../images/inf2020_009_l.jpg" alt="An illustration of a keyboard with highlighted keys: A, S, D, F, backspace, and space bar." width="633" height="187" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You will first be introduced to the A, S, D, and  F keys; the space bar; and the Backspace key. You should take some time to  practise the reaches to these keys several times before you begin.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../images/single_keys_l/spacebar_l.jpg" alt="The space bar key is shown." width="408" height="60" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The space bar is struck with the thumb on the  right hand. The left thumb is never used in keyboarding. You will need to keep  either the ring finger (L finger) or the little finger (semi finger) of your  right hand anchored as you reach to the space bar with your right thumb.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../images/single_keys_l/delete_l.jpg" alt="The delete key is shown." width="60" height="60" /> <img src="../images/single_keys_l/backspace_l.jpg" alt="The backspace key is shown." width="118" height="60" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Backspace  key is struck with the little finger on the right hand. Make sure you keep your  finger anchored on the J key while striking the backspace key.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It’s good to  make a mental picture of your finger travelling from its home position to  another key. At the same time, memorize the distance and the direction that  your finger has to travel to strike each key.<br />
