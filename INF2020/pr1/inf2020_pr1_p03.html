  <h3>Project 1: Learning the Alphanumeric and Symbol Keys</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>What Do I Need to Do?</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before you begin working through this Keyboarding  course, you will need to learn about ergonomics, how to correctly set up your  workstation, and how to be aware of workstation security. To do this, follow these  steps: </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a new word-processing document. Save the file in the  Project 1 folder and name it “Ergonomics.” To review how to open a word-processing file, watch the demonstration “<a href="../mm/inf2020_mmsave/inf2020_mmsave.htm" target="_blank">Creating and Saving a File</a>.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add a header and/or footer to your file that includes your name,  assignment name, and date. If you are using Microsoft® Word®, watch the  demonstration “<u><a href="../mm/inf2020_mmhead/inf2020_mmhead.htm" target="_blank">The Header and Footer of a Document</a></u>” to review  formatting headers and footers.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_direct_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Remember: </strong>The demonstrations provided in steps 1 and 2 are  also provided in the Toolkit so you can reference them at any time throughout  this course.<br />
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Using the Internet, the  glossary, or a dictionary, look up the word <em>ergonomics</em> and write a  definition in your own words in your word processing document. Save your  Ergonomics document.</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_linkto_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now that you know what  ergonomics is, take some time to read the information in the <a href="inf2020_pr1_p03_01.html" target="_blank">Workstation  Setup—Ergonomics</a> document. Do you have anything to add to your definition of <em>ergonomics</em>?  If so, open your document and make the changes. Then resave the document.<br />
  </p>

    </p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Watch the &ldquo;<a href="../mm/inf2020_mm003/inf2020_mm003.mov" target="_blank">Ergonomics</a>&rdquo; video. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Study the following diagram on arranging a work surface. It is  important to ensure that you, too, have a clean, well-organized area in which  to work.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is your opportunity to improve your computer workstation.  Using the information and routines you have been given, make appropriate  adjustments to your furniture, equipment, and resources. If you have access to  a camera, take before and after pictures.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Answer the following questions in your Ergonomics document.</p>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>How many changes did you make?<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>What corrections were you not able to make  because of inadequate furniture, accessories, or lab restrictions? <br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>What does practising good ergonomics and  setting up an efficient, safe, and organized work station mean to you?<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>How can making this practice a habit help you  in the long run both personally and as you enter into the workforce? </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Resave your document.  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Make stretching a part of your routine. Practise the exercises you have  been shown every 30 minutes. Be sure to exercise your shoulders, back, neck,  wrists, fingers, and arms.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_linkto_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Read the document <a href="inf2020_pr1_p02_02.html" target="_blank">Workstation  Security</a> for  information regarding hardware and software security and keeping your personal  work secure.<br />
  </p>
  <ol start="6">
    <li>Answer the following questions. You can use  Internet search terms to perform some research on these topics as well. <br />
      <br />
      a. List  three ways to protect your equipment or secure your work. <br />
      <br />
      b. List  three ways you can protect your computer from viruses. <br />
      <br />
      </li>
    <li>In the Ergonomics document you created, comment  on your areas of strength and weakness. Set a goal to improve one or two areas  you identified as needing improvement. Here are a few examples of possible  goals: <br />
        <br />
          <ul>
        <li>I  remember to stretch every 30 minutes to help reduce muscle fatigue. </li>
        <li>I save  files frequently as I work and backup important files regularly. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Complete a self-evaluation  of your workstation routines to identify areas that you may need to work on  throughout the module.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Refer to the <a href="../inf2020_rub_wkstn.doc" target="_blank">Workstation Routines Rubric</a> to self-evaluate your workstation routines. Revisit this rubric  periodically throughout the course to self-evaluate your progress in making  appropriate workstation routines a daily habit. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Take  time now to correctly set up your workstation.</p>
