  <h3>Project 1: Learning the Alphanumeric and Symbol Keys</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6>Some Other Useful Punctuation,  Symbol, and Service Keys</h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You are now going to learn some of the service keys as  well as some punctuation and symbol keys on the keyboard.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../images/inf2020_017_l.jpg" alt="This image shows a keyboard with the exclamation mark, left parenthesis, right parenthesis, dash, tab, colon, quotation mark, enter, and question mark keys highlighted." width="633" height="187" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/single_keys_l/apostrophe_l.jpg" alt="an illustration showing the apostrophe key" width="60" height="60" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong> The Apostrophe (&#8217;) Key</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  apostrophe key is used in contractions and to show possession.<br />
    <br />
  </p>
  <dl><dd><strong>possession:</strong> Tom’s motorcycle is red.<br />
      <strong>contraction:</strong> Don’t drive too fast.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>The apostrophe key is struck by moving the semi finger  sideways and to the right. Practise typing the path from the semi key to the  apostrophe key several times.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/single_keys_l/colon_l.jpg" alt="an illustration showing the colon key" width="60" height="60" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>The Colon (:) Key</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The colon is  typed by holding the left-hand Shift key down while striking the semi key.  Because two keys are needed to type the colon, you may find that you need to  type a bit slower, as with all the characters involving more than  one key.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A colon is followed by one space and is used to  introduce a list or series of items.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/single_keys_l/apostrophe_l.jpg" alt="an illustration showing the quotation mark key" width="60" height="60" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>The Quotation Mark (“) Key</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Quotation marks are used to signal direct  quotations. Quotation marks should not be separated from the quoted text by a  space. The closing quotation mark always follows the end punctuation in a piece  of quoted text. The quotation mark is typed by anchoring on the J key, holding  down the left Shift key, and striking the apostrophe key. This will require a  right sideways reach from the semi key with your little finger.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/single_keys_l/question_mark_l.jpg" alt="an illustration showing the question mark key" width="60" height="60" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>The Question Mark (?) Key</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The question  mark is used to end a sentence that asks a question. Like the period and colon,  a question mark is followed by one space. However, if the question is a quote,  the closing quotation mark will immediately follow the question mark.<br />
    <br />
  </p>
  <dl><dd>Examples:  Did Martin pass his apprenticeship exam?<br />
      Sharon asked,  “Did Martin pass his apprenticeship exam?”</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>The question  mark is typed by making a natural downward reach with the semi finger while  anchoring on the J key.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Follow through Practice 7 to practise the apostrophe,  colon, quotation marks, and question mark keys. Remember you should always be  reviewing keys already covered, as well as practising proper technique.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>Apostrophe (’), Colon (:), Quotation  Mark (“), and Question Mark (?)</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The apostrophe  key uses the semicolon finger (pinky) on your right hand.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="typewriter">;;; ’;; ;;’Jan’s  it’s we’ll your’s they’re </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The colon key  uses the semicolon finger (pinky) on your right hand. You must press the <strong>Shift</strong> key with your left hand and the <strong>semicolon</strong> key to make a colon. Space once after a colon.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="typewriter">;;; ::: ;;: :;; Ms.  Lia: Dear Mr. Mai: Remember to buy school supplies: paper, pens, and a  calculator.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Quotation  marks are found on the apostrophe key. Remember to press the <strong>Shift</strong> key with your left hand while  pressing the <strong>apostrophe</strong> with your pinky finger on your right hand. Quotation  marks signal direct quotations or dialogue.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="typewriter">“How are you today?”  asked the instructor. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="typewriter">Sharon asked, “Did  Martin pass his apprenticeship exam?”</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The question  mark key uses the semi colon finger (pinky) on your right hand. You must press  the <strong>Shift</strong> key with your left hand and then tap the <strong>question mark</strong> key to get a  question mark. The question mark is followed by one space.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="typewriter">;;; ??? ;?? ;?? Now?  How? Who? Why? Where? When?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
