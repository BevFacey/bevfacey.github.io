  <h4>Workstation Setup&mdash;Ergonomics</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Computer Setup</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  </div>
  <p>Your  workstation tools include your computer system (central processing unit,  computer monitor, keyboard, mouse, and printer), as well as any software that  you may need. Put away any items you are not using. Make sure you have space on  your desk for your mouse and for the text from which you might be typing.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Arrange  your computer hardware so that you have easy access to all components. Set your  monitor so that the screen is directly in front of you, about 60 cm away. Set  your keyboard so that you can sit directly in front of it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Seating Arrangement</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Arrange  your furniture so you can easily move about your workspace and have easy access  to all components.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your  chair must be located directly in front of the keyboard, with space for you to  move your chair easily. Arrange the position of your chair and/or monitor so  that the screen is directly in front of you. Remember, the monitor screen  should be about 60 cm away from you.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Lighting</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Proper  lighting is essential. If the lighting in your workspace is too dark or too  bright, your eyes will fatigue easily. Not only will your efficiency and  productivity suffer under poor lighting conditions, your health may also be affected. Make certain that  there is no glare on your computer screen from intense, overhead lighting or  sunlight coming through windows.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p> There is much more  you could learn about proper workspace design, suitable chairs and lighting,  and proper body position and movements. If you are interested in learning more  about these topics, use the search term <strong><em>ergonomics</em></strong> to find appropriate websites that will provide you with more information.</p>

  <h5>Health Concerns and Remedies</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_safetip_l.jpg" alt="safe tip" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p> Keyboarding can cause stress  on your eyes and other parts of your body when the proper precautions have been  ignored. Your workstation, computer, and seating must be set up properly. The  proper positioning of your body, wrists, and hands in relation to your keyboard  is also vital.<br />

  </div>
  <h5>Chair, Posture, and  Hand/Arm Position</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Being  comfortable is of utmost importance to accuracy and speed in keyboarding. One  way to maintain comfort is to use correct typing posture.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Use  a chair that fits the natural contours of your body and allows your feet to  touch the floor. Your feet should be flat on the floor with one foot slightly  in front of the other.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If the chair has armrests, make sure they are  not so high that they raise your shoulders, as this will cause muscle tension  in your shoulders, neck, and back.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Sit with your buttocks  against the back of your chair and tilt your body slightly forward, keeping  your back straight. Let your arms hang loosely at your sides with your elbows  close to your body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right2block"><img src="../images/inf2020_023_l.jpg" alt="Image of a man sitting at a computer workstation with hand open showing correct distance from abdomen to the edge of the computer desk." width="305" height="318" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your chair should be  located so that your body is one hand-span away from the edge of your keyboard.  To measure hand-span, place your hand in front of you with fingers outstretched  and the part of your hand at the wrist joint against your body. The tip of your  middle finger should touch the base of the keyboard. Ensure that your keyboard  is placed flush with the edge of the desk.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Eyestrain and Headaches</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Eyestrain  and headaches will result from glare or if your monitor is too bright. The  screen should not be placed in front of an outside window or in direct  sunlight. Overhead lights should shine at a 50- to 90-degree angle to the  screen. If the artificial lighting is too bright, adjust it by using lower-wattage  light bulbs or fluorescent tubes, or by removing one or more light bulbs from a  multiple-bulb light fixture. The intensity of some lights can be adjusted with  a dimmer switch.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Keep your screen about 60 cm away from your eyes  to ease eyestrain. Your eyes should be given a rest approximately every five  minutes by looking away from the screen.<br />

  <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
  <h5>Hand, Wrist, and  Finger Positioning</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your wrists and hands should form a straight  line when keyboarding. Your fingers should be in a natural downward cupped  position so that the tips, not the palms, of your fingers strike the keys.  Don’t allow your hands to rest on the keyboard or the desk.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Keyboarding with bent  wrists will eventually cause pain in the lower arm. You may have to tilt your  keyboard or alter the height of your chair to compensate for a desk that is too  high.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Exercises to Relieve  Muscle Aches</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You  may find that your back or your arms and wrists get sore after typing for a  period of time. If this happens, get up and stretch or exercise your back and  shoulders. It’s advisable to take frequent, short breaks.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If  your wrists or forearms get sore, you are likely holding your hands too high.  Check the angle of your hands as you’re keyboarding. The top of your forearm  and the top of your hand should be in alignment. In other words, your wrists  should not be bent. If they are bent, your desk is probably too high.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Make  sure your hands and wrists are parallel to the keyboard. Your hands should  never hang on the keyboard; they should be held just slightly above the base of  the keyboard.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Sore  wrists can be helped by shaking your hands and flexing them to loosen the  muscles. Squeezing your hand tightly and then releasing it helps to release the  tension.<br />
