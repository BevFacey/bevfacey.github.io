<h3>Orientation</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Have you ever watched someone typing quickly and accurately, seldom  looking at the keys or at his or her fingers? Did you ever wish that you could  type like that? Think of how much time you waste using the “hunt-and-peck”  method of typing, searching the keyboard for each letter. By selecting INF2020:  Keyboarding, you are well on your way to becoming a proficient touch typist!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your goal, however, might not be an easy one to achieve. You might  occasionally be faced with frustration, tired muscles, and perhaps even  boredom. It will sometimes be difficult to maintain your concentration and your  motivation to continue. However, you will reach your goal if you do these four  things: establish a routine, give yourself the time you need to develop your  skills, celebrate your successes, and believe in yourself and your ability to  succeed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>History books are full of people who accomplished great things. It’s  easy to let yourself believe that these people simply had extraordinary talents  and that their accomplishments were, therefore, achieved easily. The truth is  that these people did great things simply because they were motivated to do so.  They often had to overcome great adversity to  achieve their goals; yet  they persevered, made sacrifices, battled fatigue, endured discomfort, ignored  their critics, and overcame negative thoughts and self-doubt. Their  determination drove them on until they were rewarded by reaching their goals.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this course you will be introduced to the standard QWERTY keyboard and the   numeric keypad, as well as proper touch typing technique. You will be  encouraged to practise skills throughout the course and work through activities  that will provide evidence of your development. Successful completion of this  course will earn you one credit.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Software Requirements</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You will need  access to any kind of computer that has word-processing software, such as  Microsoft&reg; Word&reg;, WordPerfect&reg;, ClarisWorks&reg;, or Google Docs. All demonstrations  and videos will show Microsoft&reg; Word&reg; 2007 being used. If you have different  software, that is fine. Any software will do.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right1block"><img src="../images/inf2020_001_l.jpg" alt="This image shows the drop-down menus for picking the font and font size in Microsoft Word. The image shows Courier as the font and 12 point as the font size." width="159" height="38" /></div>
  <p>You will be shown how to set up a folder on your  computer in which to save your documents and assignments. For all of the  typing, you should change the font to 12 point, Courier. Font options are found  on the menu bars at the top.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Access to a printer is also recommended for  submitting assignments in paper form.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>File Management</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>All the documents you create in Keyboarding should be  saved. Select the location in which you wish to store your documents by opening  the desired file on the save screen. The location prompt is given only when you  save the document for the first time. To relocate your document at any other  time, highlight the document title or icon by clicking on it once. Then drag it  to the desired location or folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To see how to create a  folder on your desktop, watch “<a href="../mm/inf2020_mm001/inf2020_mm001.swf" target="_blank">Creating a Folder on Your Desktop</a>.” This demonstration is also located in the Toolkit for quick access at any point throughout this course.<br />

  <p>Spend as much  time practising typing as you feel you need. You may find that you work better  at certain times of the day. If this is the case, choose to do your typing  assignments at the time that is best for you. You may find that a diversion  from serious typing may help you.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is recommended  that you take frequent breaks. If you find you are starting to make a lot of  errors, stop for awhile. Then start again when you feel ready. Be careful not  to leave too much time between practice sessions, as you can lose some of what  you did learn. Practise every day, even if it’s just for a half-hour on some  days.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This course will take you 16–25 hours to complete. You  should regularly self-assess your progress by completing practice time trials.  Refer to the assessment charts for speed and accuracy and use them as your  guide. When you have completed all coursework and have practised extensively,  you may be ready for the final test.<br />
