<h3>Orientation</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Learner Expectations</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This course requires you to create and save activities that you develop  with your word-processing software. It is suggested that you create a Course  Folder on your computer to store all of the files you create as you work  through the Keyboarding course. You should also keep a printed copy of your  documents that show evidence of speed calculation or error identification, in  case your teacher asks to see them.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To achieve success in this course, be sure to read all  of the instructions carefully and work slowly through the material. Remember,  it’s the work and practice you do that will prepare you for the assignments and  the testing. Set realistic goals for yourself each day and stick to them. Do  your work regularly and don’t forget to check your work before attempting your  assignments. A final timed keyboarding test will be performed as part of your  assessment. Careful work habits will greatly increase your chances for success  in Keyboarding!</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Professionalism</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You will be  expected to perform your work in a professional manner. You will be expected to  assume a professional attitude and take the route that will lead you to the  goals required for Keyboarding.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Professionalism  includes practising every day. Proofreading your work and ensuring you are  using proper posture and technique is important. Being honest in completing  forms for reporting to your teacher is also part of the professional attitude  expected in this course.</p>

  <h5>Checking In</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You will be  required to communicate regularly with your teacher. Constant communication  with your teacher lets him or her know how you are progressing and allows you  to discuss concerns or issues you may be having. Communication can happen  in the form of e-mails, phone calls, and so on—whatever suits you best.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Timelines</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Suggested times are based on a 25-hour total. However, you may be able to complete this course in less time or it may take you a little longer. It should not take more than 32 hours. Check with your teacher to discuss timelines.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Course Outline</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Orientation</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Project 1—Learning the Alphanumeric and Symbol Keys</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Training Room 1: Calculating Your Speed</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Project 2—Learning the Numeric Keypad</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Training Room 2: Developing Speed and Accuracy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Project 3—Final Project</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Assessment</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Keyboarding  introduces most of the keys on the alphanumeric keypad and all of the keys on  the numeric keypad. Each key will be introduced by having you do several  drills. Beginning drills involve “nonsense” words (letter combinations rather  than actual words). The typing of actual words and paragraphs follows. When  sufficient drill work has been completed, you will be encouraged to participate  in a speed test and monitor your development.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After the  keys have been learned, and your desired speed has been reached, you will be  given timed writing assignments to submit for assessment. Finally, you will  complete a final timed test that will be used as assessment for the course.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Make sure you  complete all assessment documents and have your teacher sign them.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Error Management</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You may  correct errors during your timed tests by using the Backspace or Delete key.  You will discover, though, that this will bring your typing speed down. Perfect  accuracy will get you a better mark overall than typing fast with many errors.  It is recommended that you correct errors as you  type.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Don’t feel self-conscious about your keyboarding  errors. Submitting work with errors in it gives your teacher the opportunity to  analyze your error types and to give you suggestions for improving your typing  accuracy and technique. It’s all part of the learning process. You are a  beginning typist—you are supposed to make mistakes!</p>
