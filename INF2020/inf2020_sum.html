  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Looking Back</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This course has shown you the basics  of keyboarding skills. You have practised and developed your skills and  hopefully have seen some improvement. In this digital world, where computers  are as small as your cellphone and access to technology is everywhere, the  need for good keyboarding skills is as important as your ability to communicate  on paper.</p>
