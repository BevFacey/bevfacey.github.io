  <h3>Project 2: Learning the Numeric Keypad</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Exercises to Increase Speed</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you are a  beginning typist, you may find that some of your fingers are not as strong as  others. For example, it is common for a beginning typist to strike the S key  instead of the A key because the little finger is not used as often in daily  activities and does not have the strength that other fingers have.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>By moving  your fingers and tapping them as if you were typing in random order, you will  strengthen all of your fingers. This will also allow your fingers to move  faster.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Many  proficient (fast) typists say that when they were learning to type, they would  envision the keys in their mind and pretend they were typing words by just  moving their fingers in the air. (This is a good exercise for accuracy also.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Following are several other activities to strengthen  your fingers and hands.</p>

  <h6>Fingertip Curl</h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Slowly bend  the finger tips of both hands inward without closing them into a fist. Your  fingertips should touch the palm of your hand. Hold this position for a few  seconds; then slowly straighten your fingers to relax the muscles. After a few  seconds, bend your fingers again. Do this several times.<br />

  <h6>Two-Finger Stretch</h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Hold your hands in front of you with your  fingers extended and held close together. While holding the middle, ring, and  little fingers together, move the index finger as far away from the others as  possible. Hold this position for a few seconds; then allow your index finger to  return to its position next to the middle finger. Then while holding the index  and middle finger together, move them as far away as possible from the other  two fingers. Hold this position for a few seconds; then allow your fingers to  return to their normal position. Finally, move the little finger as far away as  possible from the other three.<br />
