  <h5>Estimated Required Time</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This training session will take you approximately 30  minutes.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>How to Do It </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The speed at which you type comes with practice—and  lots of it. In this session you will learn some tips that will help you develop  your touch typing speed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Pacing</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It’s good to type with a rhythm when learning how to  type. Some people find that using a metronome helps keep them in rhythm. Teachers  will often pace students through beginning exercises to help them establish a  rhythm. If you are working alone, you can maintain a rhythm by pacing yourself.  Say each letter to yourself as you strike it, keeping a definite rhythm or  timing.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>For example,  consider the following phrase.</dt>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dd class="typewriter">The lake is calm.</dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt>If you were  typing this phrase, you might choose to type with the following rhythm, where  you stress the first character of each set of two characters</dt>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dd>Th   e[space]  la  ke   [space]i  s[space]  ca  lm</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>Rhythm helps improve accuracy.</p>

The student says, “When your speed increases, does the rhythm slow you down?” The teacher replies, “No, the rhythm takes its own shape as speed increases. Often, no particular rhythm is obvious when speeds become fast.”" width="445" height="375" /></p>
