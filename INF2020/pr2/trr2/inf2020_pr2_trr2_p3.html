  <h3>Project 2: Learning the Numeric Keypad</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Time to Practise </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Take some time in between practise sessions to  practise these exercises. Complete the exercises in order to develop strength  and flexibility in your fingers so they are able to make the reaches quickly.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Checking In</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On your word  processor, complete the timed writings that follow. You will need a friend or family member to supervise your timed writing attempt. Your goal is  between 30–50 wpm on the alphanumeric timings, and between 100–150 kpm on the  numeric timings. You are allowed to use the backspace key to correct errors while being timed. <strong>Do not  correct any errors after the time allowed is up.</strong> You may repeat the timed  writing as many times as it takes to reach the required speed and accuracy  goals.</p>

  <p> Open <a href="inf2020_pr2_trr2_01.doc" target="_blank">Time to Practise 2</a> and print the timed writings. You will also need your Project 2 Assessment document.<br />

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong> </strong>Have someone  (preferably a touch typist) watch you while you type. Refer to <a href="../../inf2020_tech.doc" target="_blank">Technique  Evaluation</a> as you will be  evaluated according to this rubric.<br />

  <p>Discuss with your teacher whether you are ready  for the final exercise for the course. The final exercise consists of six  timed  writings and is designed to test you interactively.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The design of the six timed exercises is the same as  your final test. The final exercise will time you, determine your speed and  accuracy, and allow you to determine your readiness to attempt the final test.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Make sure you revisit  any of the documents for more  practice exercises or to review tips and techniques. Revisit the rubrics for  reminders of how you will be assessed by your teacher.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you are ready to attempt the Final Project, let your teacher know.</p>
