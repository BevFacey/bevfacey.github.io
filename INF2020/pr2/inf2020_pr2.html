  <h3>Project 2: Learning the Numeric Keypad</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this project you will be introduced to the  numeric keys on the numeric keypad. You will learn their reaches, and you will practise  the correct finger position and movement on the numeric keypad. When you are  familiar with the keys and reaches, you will then take time to practise what  you have learned. When you feel ready, you will perform some timed writings  with your teacher. You and your teacher will then compare your results with the  performance standards. Your teacher will give you guidance, help you determine  your speed and accuracy, and give you feedback on your typing technique.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Project Assessment(s)</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this project you will be assessed in these areas:<br />
  </p>
  <ul><li>&nbsp;touch  typing skills—completing a number of exercises and one-minute timed writing tests<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li>touch  typing technique—addressed through workstation routines and the completion of a  technique assessment<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>basic competencies developed in your learning of the  alphanumeric keypad and the numeric keypad </li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Skill Level</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Keyboarding your goal is to touch type at a  speed of between 100–150 keys per minute (kpm) on the keypad with no more than  one uncorrected error. The length of timings for this section will be one minute. Check the assessment documents to see where your skill level falls.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Estimated Required  Time </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To properly develop your touch typing skills on  the numeric keypad, you should commit to daily learning and memorization of the  keys. You may need to spend some time practising the key locations and doing  practise timed tests until you feel confident that your skill level matches the  assessment requirements of this course. Most of the time spent in this course  will be practising. This project will take you somewhere between six and nine hours,  which includes covering course material, practising, completing exercises and  self-checks, and communicating with your teacher.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Environmental Impact</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To save electricity, turn off your computer and anything else on your  workstation when you are finished practising.</p>
