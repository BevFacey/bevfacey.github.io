  <p>Imagine yourself as the boss or the owner of a company. What basic  skills would you look for in your employees? What are the characteristics of a  valuable employee? Workplace skills and  attributes are called Basic Competencies in Career and Technology Studies.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Practising and refining  your basic competency skills on a daily basis will help you be more productive  and successful in every task you undertake, whether at school, at work, or in  your personal life. Basic competencies are the soft skills employers value in  their employees, what group members value in their peers, and skills that give  you a sense of pride and satisfaction in your work.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="left2blockColour">
    <p><strong>soft skill:</strong> a person’s personality,  social refinement, language skills, or personal and/or work habits that  contributes to efficient and successful productivity</p>
  </div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>All people, to some degree, have basic competency skills. Existing  skills can improve with time and experience, and you can always learn new  skills that improve soft skills. People who are successful often possess a  variety of soft skills in the workplace. It has been argued that the mastery of  basic competency skills contributes to the degree of success individuals  attain.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  Perform the following steps:
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> With a partner, in a small group, or on a discussion board,  brainstorm a list of vital skills that relate to being successful. From the  list you create, determine which skills are necessary for a variety of areas,  like school (secondary or post-secondary), on the job, or in your personal  life. You can document your list in a new word processing document on your  computer. Be sure to save your list as Basic Competencies in your INF2020  folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The following is a list of basic competencies deemed necessary  for this course and other CTS courses:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Fundamental       Skills<br clear="all" />
      – communicating<br clear="all" />
      – managing information<br clear="all" />
      – using numbers<br clear="all" />
      – thinking and problem solving<br clear="all" />
      <br clear="all" />
    </li>
    <li>Personal       Management Skills<br clear="all" />
      – demonstrating positive attitudes and behaviours<br clear="all" />
      – being responsible<br clear="all" />
      – being adaptable<br clear="all" />
      – learning continuously<br clear="all" />
      – working safely<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;Teamwork       Skills<br clear="all" />
      – working with others<br clear="all" />
      – participating in projects and tasks </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Compare your list to the basic competencies listed in Step 1; then  answer the questions that follow in your Basic Competencies document.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Are there any skills under  Fundamental, Personal Management, or Teamwork that you didn’t mention in your  list?<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Did you think of any  skills that were not covered in the three groups listed above? </li>
  </ol>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_assesment_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Print a copy of the <a href="../inf2020_rub_bc.doc" target="_blank">Basic  Competencies Rubric</a>. Complete a pre-course self-evaluation on your  basic competency skills.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Below the list you created  in Step 1, write a short paragraph about a time in your life when you  demonstrated basic competencies. Include work, school, or personal life  experiences in your paragraph. It would be beneficial to discuss how the  competency you identified impacted the example you provided. Save the changes  to your Basic Competencies document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Choose one or two  competency areas in which you can make improvements. Write an action statement  of how you plan to practise the identified competencies. Identify the benefits  of practising the competencies. Here is one example:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="4%">&nbsp;</td>
      <td width="96%"><h6>Basic Competency: Manage  Information</h6>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Action Plan:</strong> Create and use suitable file names and organize  files in appropriate folders.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> I save time when I can easily find my documents.</p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Save the changes to your Basic Competencies  document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Checking Your Work</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_assesment_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Use the <a href="../inf2020_rub_bc.doc" target="_blank">Basic Competencies Rubric</a> as a self-check to  ensure that you are routinely thinking about using the basic competencies as  you work.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now you are ready to learn  the numeric keypad. Good luck!</p>
