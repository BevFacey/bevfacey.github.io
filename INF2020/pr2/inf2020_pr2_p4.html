  <h3>Project 2: Learning the Numeric Keypad</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Time to Work</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This project should take you anywhere between  six and nine hours to complete. Remember, work at your own pace, take frequent breaks, and  refer to the toolkit and training sessions for review. Most of this project  will be time spent practising keystrokes on the numeric keypad.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You  have all the information you need to be on your way to becoming proficient on  the numeric keypad. Now you need to practise. As with the alphanumeric keypad,  you must memorize the key locations and the reaches and you must practise. Each  time you work on Keyboarding, set aside some time to practise the keys on both  the alphanumeric and numeric keypads. When you feel that you are ready to be  evaluated, communicate that to your teacher.</p>
