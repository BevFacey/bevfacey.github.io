* Prerequisite: DES1020: The Design Process

CSE1110: Structured Programming 1
* Students are introduced to a general programming environment in which they write simple structured algorithms and programs that input, process and output data, use some of the more basic operators and data types, and follow a sequential flow of control.

ELT1910: ELT Project A
* Students develop project design and management skills to extend and enhance competencies and skills in other CTS courses through contexts that are personally relevant.

ELT1140: Robotics Applications
* Students apply the fundamentals of robotics systems and basic robotics functions.
