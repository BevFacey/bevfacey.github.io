 ## Modules

[ELT1010: Electro-assembly 1](ELT1010.md)

* Students apply basic fabricating and servicing techniques to construct and test electronic and electromagnetic devices and cables.
* Prerequisite: None

[ELT1080: Control Systems 1](ELT1080.md)

* Students construct process control systems, demonstrate their basic operation and demonstrate procedures for testing them.
* Prerequisite: [ELT1010: Electro-assembly 1](ELT1010.md)

[CSE1110: Structured Programming 1](CSE1110.md)

* Students are introduced to a general programming environment in which they write simple structured algorithms and programs that input, process and output data, use some of the more basic operators and data types, and follow a sequential flow of control.
* Prerequisite: None

[ELT1130: Robotics 1](ELT1130.md)

* Students apply the fundamentals of robotics systems and basic robotics functions. *Note: this uses a robotic arm*
* Prerequisite: None

[ELT1140: Robotics Applications](ELT1040.md)

* Students apply the fundamentals of robotics systems and basic robotics functions. *Note: this uses drones*
* Prerequisite: [ELT1010: Electro-assembly 1](ELT1010.md)

[ELT1910: ELT Project A](ELT1910.md)

* Students develop project design and management skills to extend and enhance competencies and skills in other CTS courses through contexts that are personally relevant.
