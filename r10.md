# Robotics 10

[DES1020: The Design Process](DES1020.md)

* Students develop an understanding of design problems through research and select, generate and evaluate possible solutions.

[DES1040: 3-D Design 1](DES1040.md)

* Students develop skills and techniques for 3-D design, by using tools, materials and processes common to 3-D design to complete a variety of project activities.
* Prerequisite: DES1020: The Design Process

[ELT1010: Electro-assembly 1](ELT1010.md)

* Students apply basic fabricating and servicing techniques to construct and test electronic and electromagnetic devices and cables.

[ELT1130: Robotics 1](ELT1130.md)

* Students apply the fundamentals of robotics systems and basic robotics functions.

[CSE1110: Structured Programming 1](CSE1110.md)

* Students are introduced to a general programming environment in which they write simple structured algorithms and programs that input, process and output data, use some of the more basic operators and data types, and follow a sequential flow of control.

[ELT1910: ELT Project A](ELT1910.md)

* Students develop project design and management skills to extend and enhance competencies and skills in other CTS courses through contexts that are personally relevant.

ELT1140: Robotics Applications

* Students apply the fundamentals of robotics systems and basic robotics functions.
