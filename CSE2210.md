# CSE2210: Client-side Scripting 3

# CSE3120: Object-oriented Programming 1

Students add to their understanding of programming paradigms by moving from a procedural programming approach, in which modularity is handled through subprograms, to an object-oriented approach, in which it is handled through objects. They learn a simple object-oriented analysis and design approach based on the use of object diagrams and write programs that use objects associated with one another in a client/server relationship.

## Coding

* Demonstrate basic procedural programming approaches and how they can be used to write Internet scripts
    * include the following features:
        * subprograms that can be readily mapped to specific components of a site’s architecture
        * the decomposition of complex scripting tasks into subtasks improving site design efficiency, maintainability and extendibility
        * the potential for code reuse both in the same and in other scripts and sites
        * the enhancement of site security through improved data hiding and information protection
        * the enhancement of the readability of site scripts
        * the promotion of collaborative work on site scripts
        * the reduction of unwanted side effects especially when dealing with multiple scripts
* Demonstrate basic procedural programming approaches and how they can be used to create development libraries of scriptlets
    * demonstrate how they:
        * increase design, coding and debugging efficiency
        * increase user and/or site interactivity
* Demonstrate the use of data structures in an Internet scripting environment
    * outline the data structures available in a typical Internet scripting environment
    * compare and contrast data structures such as arrays with primitive data types
    * describe and represent the main operations associated with the fundamental data structures supported by a typical Internet scripting environment
* Design scripts for an appropriate Internet-oriented scripting environment that uses procedural programming approaches and fundamental data structures
    * outline the intent of the script and determine if the intent can be best realized through the use of procedural programming approaches
    * determine the data requirements of the script and determine if the intent can be best realized through the use of fundamental data structures Intermediate
    * create algorithms that use procedural programming approaches to realize the intent of the script including:
        * use a top-down design approach to decompose the problem first into modules and then into submodules
        * use pseudocode or an appropriate diagramming technique to illustrate the relationship among the modules
        * create more detailed algorithms for each module identifying the pre- and post-conditions and required program control of flow mechanisms
        * test and modify the developing algorithm with appropriate data using a “fail-on-paper” process
* Write and debug scripts that use procedural programming approaches and fundamental data structures using an appropriate Internet-oriented scripting environment
    * demonstrate the ability to use an appropriate scripting language coding environment
    * convert the algorithms into scripts consisting of linked modules/subprograms that reflect the structure of the algorithm
    * use appropriate types of subprograms to implement the various sections of the algorithm
    * maintain an appropriate balance between the coupling or dependency and cohesion or focus of the subprograms
    * use internal and external documentation
    * execute the script, and track and eradicate errors
    * compare the results of the script’s execution with the intent of the algorithm and modify, as required
