# COM2035: Raster Graphics 1

* A raster format is commonly used in full colour images/graphics and photographs by using a data structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels or points of colour. In this course, students are introduced to the fundamental skills of raster graphics and their application.
* Prerequisite: [COM1035: Graphics Tools](COM1035.md)

## Assignment 1 - Create and Edit Raster Images

1. Using a photo editing program such as Photoshop or GIMP set up a document, considering:
    1. size
    2. resolution
    3. colour mode
    4. background
2. organize and manage image files using correct file conventions by:
    1. considering aspects of file size
    2. explaining the benefits of different file formats
3. correct, paint and retouch images by:
    1. adjusting options and painting; e.g., brush types, pencil, blending
    2. using retouch tools appropriately given various situations
    3. creating and using gradients and patterns
    4. using filters
4. work with selections by:
    1. creating a selection using the appropriate selection tool
    2. saving and loading selections
    3. moving and transforming selections
5. create and use layers by:
    1. creating and arranging layers appropriately; e.g., using layer groups
    2. creating and using layer effects
    3. creating and using layer styles
6. work with masks by:
    1. explaining the use of masks
    2. using masks and painting tools to create and edit a layer mask
7. work with vector tools by:
    1. creating shape layers and paths using vector tools
8. automate tasks
9. manage colour by:
    1. describing the process and components of colour management; e.g., profiles, working spaces, rendering intents, settings
    2. describing the proper colour conversion given common situations; e.g., red-green-blue (RGB) colour model for Web and video, cyan-magenta-yellow-key black (CMYK) colour model for prepress
10. prepare image for output by:
    1. creating a proof
    2. discussing and using options in print dialog box
    3. creating a flattened CMYK image
    4. creating a layered RGB with layer comps
    5. creating a .pdf with vector layers

## Assignment 2 - Presentation

1. Present a selection of work completed in this course to an audience.
2. Based on feedback and reflection, give yoursef a rating on a scale of 1 to 4 for each of the following:
    1. how the elements and principles of design help facilitate good composition
    2. the technical and creative aspects of the work; e.g., quality, uniqueness
    3. areas of concern/difficulty (if applicable)
    4. meeting school and community standards; e.g., appropriate language
    5. the use of tools and equipment

## Competencies and Skills

You will also be evaluated on your basic competencies such as your ability to:

* communicate
* manage information
* use numbers
* think and solve problems
* demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours
* be responsible
* be adaptable
* learn continuously
* work safely
* work with others
* participate in projects and tasks
* recognize and then analyze the opportunities and barriers in the immediate environment
* identify potential resources to minimize barriers and maximize opportunities
