# NET2110: Telecommunications

Students learn how to select and use various wired and wireless telecommunication systems. By using the Internet, they investigate how communication principles, bandwidth, telecommunication infrastructure and wave spectrum affect telecommunication systems.

## Theory

**Complete the remaining chapters in IT Essentials on [Cisco Networking Academy](https://netacad.com).**


1. use selected communication systems, protocols and techniques to transfer messages, do online activities and manage research
1.1 outline basic elements of a communication system
1.2 describe the development of wired, wireless and Web-based communication systems
1.3 identify key components of wired, wireless and Web-based telecommunication systems
1.4 identify examples of how telecommunication systems are merging and connecting to improve service to various client groups
2. describe the principles of wired, wireless and Web-based communication systems and how telecommunication systems are affected by bandwidth and wave spectrum
2.1 describe how computers send and receive various types of information/data; e.g., voice, data, documents, visuals, multimedia
2.2 identify and describe telecommunication transmission systems in terms of bandwidth and wave spectrum including:
2.2.1 wired; e.g., twisted pair telephone cable, coaxial cable, special data cables, fibre optics
2.2.2 wireless; e.g., radar/microwave, radio, satellite data links
2.2.3 digital versus analog
2.3 describe various types of transmission systems including:
2.3.1 type of information that can be transmitted; e.g., voice, pictures
2.3.2 present installation base
2.3.3 user cost
3. compare and contrast key elements of a telecommunication infrastructure
3.1 identify key elements of an effective telecommunication infrastructure including:
3.1.1 information and interactive applications/services; e.g., entertainment, education, cultural products, social services, business services, learning management systems
3.1.2 transmission systems; e.g., links with/among homes, businesses, governments/education and institutions
3.1.3 software applications; e.g., enable the operation of computers, manipulation of data, protection of data, transmission and reception of data and access to communication networks and their information such as social networks or learning management systems 
3.1.4 standards and protocols that allow access to, or secure the contents of, information and networks
3.1.5 people/expertise needed to create the information, technology, equipment, peripherals, software and services, to provide the information, to construct the facilities and to educate others on its use and benefits
3.2 evaluate one or more telecommunication initiatives in terms of the key elements of an information technology infrastructure within one or more of the following areas:
3.2.1 personal; e.g., personal networks, interests, learning
3.2.2 electronic commerce; e.g., allows consumers/businesses to interact such as 1â€“800 numbers, electronic data interchange, data exchange
3.2.3 health care; e.g., remote diagnostics, patient information sharing, training
3.2.4 research
3.2.5 education and training; e.g., distance learning/course delivery via learning management systems
3.2.6 libraries; e.g., online
3.2.7 government services; e.g., federal, provincial
3.2.8 information services; e.g., information about government services, reports
3.2.9 technology-based process/procedures, filing income taxes electronically, electronic submissions of contract bids/tendering, teleconferencing
3.2.10 law enforcement services; e.g., international/national sharing of criminal data, teleconferenced parole hearings
3.2.11 labour force development; e.g., flexible, readily upgraded training programs
3.2.12 environmental monitoring

Throughout the course you will also be evaluated on your basic competencies such as your ability to:

* communicate
* manage information
* use numbers
* think and solve problems
* demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours
* be responsible
* be adaptable
* learn continuously
* work safely
* work with others
* participate in projects and tasks
