## Practice

1. Install and use packet-sniffing software, such as [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org), to capture and analyze data packets and frames.
1. Select an appropriate network topology and architecture, and design a network to address user needs, given a particular set of network requirements.
    * For example, assemble a LAN gaming network.
1. Create a schematic diagram for the physical layout of your designed network.
