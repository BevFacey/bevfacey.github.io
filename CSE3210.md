# CSE 3210: Server-side Scripting 1

Students add to their ability to craft dynamic Web sites by exploring the fundamentals of server-side scripting.  In the process, they add to their understanding of Internet scripting by employing databases as a repository for the information to be displayed by their sites.  Students learn how to analyze, modify, write and debug algorithms and server-side scripts that use simple databases.

* Prerequisites: [CSE2210: Client-side Scripting 3](CSE2210.md), [CSE2110: Procedural Programming 1](CSE2110.md), [CSE2120: Data Structures 1](CSE2120.md)

## Theory

Demonstrate an understanding of the key features of server-side environments and server-side scripting
1. compare and contrast server-side scripting with dynamic client-side scripting including:
    * outline the limitations of dynamic client-side scripting including security and quality of experience issues
    * outline the advantages of server-side scripting including broader features available, developer control of application environment, greater interactivity, scalability and maintainability
    * outline the disadvantages of server-side scripting
    * describe how client-side and server-side scripting can and should be used to complement one another
    * describe two Web applications made possible by server-side scripting approaches
    * describe a server-side language and compare it with one or more client-side languages
2. describe the system architecture of a typical server-side environment including:
    * describe and represent the multitiered nature of a typical server-side environment
    * describe the role played and capabilities needed by Web server software in a typical server-side environment
    * describe the role played and capabilities needed by database and/or other information managers in a typical server-side environment
    * describe the role played by the server-side scripting language in a typical server-side environment
    * represent how a request from a client would be handled in a typical multitiered server-side environment

Describe the processes and characteristics of a server-side environment
1. describe the various tiers that make up an environment including:
    * identify the Web server software used in an environment and describe the role(s) it/they will be required to play
    * identify the database manager and/or other information managers used in an environment and describe the role(s) it/they will be required to play
    * identify the server-side scripting language(s) used in an environment and describe the role(s) it/they will be required to play
    * identify and describe at least one significant task or application that a server-side environment could be used to carry out

## Practical

Use appropriate techniques to design applications for use in a server-side scripting environment
* outline the intent of the application and determine if that intent can be advantageously realized through the use of a server-side environment including:
    * determine the data handling requirements of the application, and determine if the application and information tiers of an environment are capable of handling those requirements
    * determine the input/output requirements of the application, and determine if the client tier of an environment is capable of handling those requirements
* use an appropriate design technique to write the necessary algorithm(s) including:
    * use an appropriate technique to represent the relationship among the modules
    * write more detailed algorithms for each module and identify the pre- and post-conditions and program control of flow mechanisms required for any subprograms
* test the developing algorithm with appropriate data using a “fail-on-paper” process
* revise the algorithm, as required

Write and debug the scripts required to implement a server-side application
* demonstrate the ability to use an appropriate server-side scripting language environment
* convert the algorithms into scripts consisting of collaborating modules that reflect the structure of the algorithm including:
    * use appropriate subprograms and/or objects to implement the various sections of the algorithm
    * maintain an appropriate balance between the coupling or dependency and cohesion or focus of the modules
    * pass data between the modules without unintended side-effects
    * use internal and external documentation
* execute the script, and track and eradicate errors
* compare the results of the script’s execution with the intent of the algorithm and modify, as required
