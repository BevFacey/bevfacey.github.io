  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In INF1030: Word Processing 1 you developed your  skills and became comfortable using word-processing software. Now it’s time to  start taking your skills beyond the basics and use even more of your software’s  features. It’s also time to examine opportunities, challenges, and resources as  you identify possible life roles and career pathways in <strong>business</strong>, <strong>administration</strong>, or <strong>finance&nbsp;and information technology</strong>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>INF2050: Word Processing 2 is an intermediate-level Information  Processing course that will expand your word-processing and document production  skills. You will create, format, edit, and produce commonly used documents&mdash;such as letters, reports, tables, and newsletters&mdash;for personal and business  use. As you work through the course, you will also learn how to establish  proper routines and practices to promote safety and security, as well as practise  basic competencies (employability skills) to help you achieve success.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you  complete INF2050: Word Processing 2, you will have learned transferable skills  that could set you apart from other students, other job applicants, and even  other employees. Consider the value of using higher-level word-processing  skills to complete your school assignments now, and the value of transferring  these skills to the post-secondary environment or to any career you may choose.  People with skills save time and stand out. Are you one of those people? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>INF2050: Word Processing 2 builds your skills towards  obtaining Microsoft Office Certification, and is a prerequisite course to INF3060: Word Processing 3. Students continuing on the path towards Microsoft  Office Certification should also complete INF3060: Word Processing 3.<br />
  </p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/graphics/inf2050_009_l.jpg" alt="This graphic shows the increasing levels of INF courses and Microsoft Word Certification opportunities: INF1030: Word Processing 1: Introduce; INF2050: Word Processing 2: Develop; INF 3060: Word Processing 3: Master; Microsoft Word Specialist Exam; and Microsoft Word Certified Specialist." width="540" height="235" /></p>
  <p>There is no  prerequisite course for INF2050; however, INF1030: Word Processing 1 is a  recommended supporting course and students must have a solid foundation in  basic word-processing skills before beginning INF2050. This course is  designed using Microsoft Office Word 2007 on a PC, but activities can be  completed using previous versions of Microsoft Word or other available word-processing  programs. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You are encouraged to use keyword searches in Help menus and online  references to find software-specific demonstrations and tips to assist you in  completing the learning activities. Microsoft Office Online is a rich source of  help, training, demos, and quizzes that will help you learn Microsoft programs.  Remember that your teacher is also there to guide and assist you.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>As you work through the training rooms, you will learn how to perform the  following tasks:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Create and  customize documents. </strong>Advance your word-processing software skills  to create more sophisticated documents, such as cover letters, research papers,  brochures, advertisements, customized calendars, and magazine articles.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Format  content.</strong> Lay out your documents professionally  and efficiently.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Work with  visual content.</strong> Create and manipulate graphics for eye-catching results.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Organize content. </strong>Use<strong> </strong>software features to create more  complex documents faster and make them easier to navigate. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Review documents. </strong>Collaborate on  document editing.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Share and secure  content</strong>.  Get documents ready for publication.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Apply  consistent and appropriate workstation routines. </strong>Create a safe and  secure work environment.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Demonstrate basic  competencies. </strong>Learn  and practice employability skills. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Identify roles and career pathways related to Business  and Information Technology.</strong> Explore  ways to apply the skills you develop in  this course to other areas of your life  (opportunities, resources, challenges).</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Upon finishing the training for this course, you will  be ready to complete your final project, a workplace simulation.  When you have successfully completed all of  the course requirements, including the final project and your skills  assessments, you will earn one credit towards your high school diploma.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Industry  Skills&mdash;Microsoft Certification</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Microsoft Corporation is recognized worldwide as  the industry leader in desktop productivity and IT software. Acquiring  Microsoft credentials distinguishes your skills in the job market, giving you a  distinct advantage over the competition. Microsoft certification ensures that you  have the technical skills and the practical work experience necessary to  confidently and successfully handle the demands of a busy workplace. Your personal investment in the  certification process will be recognized by your peers, your customers, and  your employers as a demonstration of your commitment to advancing your skills  and to life-long learning.</p>
