  <h3>Project 1: Workstation Routines and Management</h3>

  <p>Have you ever actually read the software  licensing terms of the software you run on your computer? Have you ever  scratched or damaged your CDs or DVDs, contracted a computer virus, or spilled  a drink on your keyboard? Have you ever worked or played on a computer for so  long that your muscles burned in your back or in your neck or felt your eyes  sting from staring at the screen? Or have your hands ever cramped up or felt tingly  after keyboarding, gaming, or instant messaging?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It’s easy to become so absorbed when working at  the computer that you forget how long you have been sitting in one position,  overstressing your muscles, and straining your eyes.<br />

  <p>Working with computers can be problematic if you  don't follow good routines and practices that protect both your health and your  equipment. However, making good workstation routines a habit will help you  minimize or prevent damage to equipment, loss of personal work, and injuries associated  with using a computer and help increase your productivity, personal  satisfaction, and sense of accomplishment.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this project you will discover and practise appropriate workstation  routines, setting personal goals for yourself to be aware and to practise  ergonomic routines each time you sit at a computer.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What is required to  complete this project?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To complete this project you will need the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Workstation  Routines Rubric</li>
    <li>Internet access</li>
    <li>camera (film,  digital, or cell phone) or web cam</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What do I already know?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You may have already completed another CTS module and have learned  about and have practised good workstation routines. If this is the case, now is  a good time to review the Workstation Routines Rubric and set new goals for  improving your workstation routines in different areas. Check with your  teacher about how to proceed for this section.  </p>

  <div class="right2blockColour">
    <p><strong>repetitive strain injury:</strong>  overuse of the muscles through repeated  movements that put stress on certain body parts, such as wrists or elbows</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>carpal tunnel syndrome:</strong> a medical condition in which the median nerve is  compressed at the wrist causing pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand or  wrist that can radiate up the arm</p>
  </div>
  <p>You may have seen people wear braces on their wrists for <strong>repetitive  strain injury</strong> or <strong>carpal tunnel syndrome</strong>, and you probably know that people can develop  injuries from poor body posture, improper keyboard and mouse techniques, and  prolonged intervals in front of a computer. Think about an experience where you  spent an extended amount of time doing the same task, like playing a video game  or shovelling the snow. The repetitive movement of one part of your body can  cause strain and discomfort.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What do I need to do?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>learn about  workstation ergonomics and computer safety and security</li>
    <li>analyze your  workstation and make necessary improvements </li>
    <li>apply and practise  the skills</li>
    <li>self-evaluate  your workstation position and routines</li>
  </ul>
