  <h3>Project 4: Final Project</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before beginning the final project, make sure  that you are confident in demonstrating all of the skills on the <a href="../inf2050_skilllscheck.doc" target="_blank">Software  Skills Assessment Checklist</a> to determine your  readiness for final evaluation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In  this course, you have learned some important word-processing skills that will  give you the competitive edge in the workplace as well as prepare you to become  Microsoft Certified. Now it is time to demonstrate your skills by preparing  documents for your final assessment. Keep in mind that you may use this final  project to begin creating a professional portfolio of your work to show  potential employers and post-secondary institutions. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What is Required to Complete  this Project?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In order to complete this project, you will need</p>
  <ul>
    <li>directions to  complete the five final project pieces</li>
    <li>the Final  Assessment Rubric for all parts of the final project</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What Do I Already Know?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Through the training rooms you have learned the necessary content and  software skills to complete the final projects.
