  <h5>Final Project 2: Fax Template </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When  you fax documents, you always need to include a fax cover page to provide the recipient  with information about the documents you have sent. In this part of the final  project, you will create a fax cover page that you can use to send your resum&eacute; package  to prospective employers. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Using  the built-in templates in Microsoft Word, create a professional-looking fax  cover page:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In Microsoft  Word&rsquo;s Fax template, enter all relevant information to send your fax to  Smartech Strategic Technical Support.<br />
    <br />
  </p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use  Insert Symbol to check off how you would like the receiver to respond (e.g.,  Urgent, For Review, Please Comment, Please Reply, etc.).<br />
    <br />
  </p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Insert  a brief comment expressing your interest in the position and requesting an  interview.<br />
    <br />
  </p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Save  the template as &ldquo;Fax&rdquo; in your INF2050: WP 2: Final Project folder.</p>
