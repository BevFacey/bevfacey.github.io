  <p>Bullets and numbers help you organize your thoughts  and make information easier for your readers to follow. Using  the Bullets, Numbering, and Multilevel List buttons found on the Home tab of  your Microsoft Word 2007 ribbon, you can easily create bulleted, numbered, and multilevel  lists. There are a few ways you can add bullets and numbers to your document:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can start bullets by typing an asterisk (*) and  then the Tab key or the spacebar. Each time you press Enter, the next bullet  will be added. Or, you can simply click the Bullets button on the Home tab before  you type the text.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>You can start  numbering by typing &ldquo;1.&rdquo; and then hitting the Tab key or the spacebar. Each  time you press Enter, the next number will be added. Or, you can simply click  the Numbers button on the Home tab before you type the text.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>You can also select text you have already entered into  your document and then click the Bullets or Numbering buttons and choose your  preferred formatting.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can change the bullets or numbers by clicking  the down arrow beside each button to access a library of different bullet symbols  or number formats. Options include changing your list to a checklist that you  can then put into action.</p>
