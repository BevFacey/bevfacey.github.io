  <h5>Creating Custom Letterheads and Stationery Templates</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You don&rsquo;t need to be a graphic artist to design  good-looking letterheads — you have all the tools you need right in Microsoft  Word. Let&rsquo;s learn how to use text boxes, graphics, watermarks, and backgrounds  to create professional-looking stationery. You will also learn how you can save  your stationery as a template so you can reuse your creations again and again to  save time and money.</p>

  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr3/inf_mmpr3tr3.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Creating a Letterhead&rdquo; to learn how  to create a custom letterhead you and your boss will be proud of.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is important to explore all the features and  options in the Tools menus that appear when you select text boxes, graphics,  and illustrations. The Picture tools, Drawing tools, and Text Box tools allow  you to modify and manipulate your objects until they are perfect for your  document. Take some time to experiment after you go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr3/inf_mmpr3tr3.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Picture Tools, Text Tools, Formatting Tools on the Ribbon.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll be surprised by how quickly you can customize your work.</p>

  <p>Watermarks and backgrounds can add colour and  dimension to your documents. A watermark is washed-out text or graphic elements that  appear faintly behind a document’s text. Watermarks are used to enhance the  look of a document, or to provide information about the document, such as that  it is a &ldquo;Draft Copy.&rdquo; Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr3/inf_mmpr3tr3.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Creating a Watermark&rdquo; to learn how to add a  watermark to your document. To see how a watermark will appear on the printed  page, use the Print Layout view.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you have created a custom document, you can save it as a template so that the document can be reused without having  to recreate it or edit out unwanted content each time. Saving a document as a  template creates a copy of that document, allowing you to edit the new copy  without changing the original. Templates save time if you use a certain type of document frequently. In business, companies  increase productivity by using templates to generate common business correspondence  with their corporate letterhead, such as monthly billing statements. </p>

  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr3/inf_mmpr3tr3.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Word Template&rdquo; and &ldquo;Opening a Saved Template&rdquo; to learn how to save your  document as a template that you can reuse.</p>
