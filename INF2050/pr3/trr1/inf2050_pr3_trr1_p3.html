  <h3>Project 3: Documents for Personal and Business Use</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Setting Up New Documents</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To change your document measurement from centimeters to inches (metric to imperial), click the Office button and choose Word  Options, Advanced, Display.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you start a new document, it is important  to set up the page according to your preferences or the demands of the document  type. For example, a letter will look much different from a full-colour  newsletter. Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr1/inf2050_mmpr3tr1.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Settings in a New Document&rdquo; to learn how to set up a new  document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Organize and Identify Files </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Use the  Document Properties feature in Microsoft&reg; Word&reg; 2007 to organize and identify  your work. The Document Properties feature stores important data about a  document, such as its title and author or keywords that identify its subject or  content. This kind of data is called metadata, which essentially means data  about data. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr1/inf2050_mmpr3tr1.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Document Properties&rdquo; to learn how to set standard document  properties, or metadata, for your documents.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr1/inf2050_mmpr3tr1.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Using Document Properties&rdquo; to learn how to view document properties as you open a file.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Quick Clicks and Keystrokes</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Microsoft&reg; Word&reg; offers many ways to access software commands and features. Learning keyboard  shortcut keys&mdash;such as Ctrl + S for Save  and Ctrl + P for Print&mdash;will speed  up production and improve ergonomics by reducing your hands&rsquo; movements from  keyboard to mouse. You can find keyboard shortcuts in the ScreenTip that appears  as you hover over command buttons. Make it a habit to take note of keyboard  shortcuts and use them whenever you can.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Another way  to quickly access software commands is by using the right mouse button. In  Microsoft&reg; Word&reg; 2007, when you select text and click the right mouse button  (“right-click”), a menu of formatting commands appears. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Some commonly used commands that you can access by  right-clicking the mouse are Cut, Copy, and Paste. Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr1/inf2050_mmpr3tr1.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Copy and Paste&rdquo;  to see how the mouse is used to copy and paste text and to learn how the  clipboard stores items for pasting.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right2block">

  </div>
  <p>For easier editing and review, you can view a document's hidden formatting codes. Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr1/inf2050_mmpr3tr1.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;The Show/Hide Tool&rdquo; to see how the Show/Hide button reveals non-printing paragraph marks and other hidden formatting symbols. In Training Room 5: Reports, you will learn how to use the Reveal Formatting command to see even more detailed source code.</p>
