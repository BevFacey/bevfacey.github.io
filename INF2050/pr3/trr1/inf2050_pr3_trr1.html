  <p>In INF1030: Word Processing 1 you discovered  the advantages of having basic word-processing skills. You have probably used  those skills to do your school assignments, write letters and reports, create  posters with graphics, and maybe even to create a table for your science lab  results. By now, you may have realized the benefit of developing more advanced word-processing  skills to make document production faster and easier, and to make your documents  more professional-looking. The more you work with Microsoft Word, the more  features you will learn. You will start to notice all of the practical uses of  these features in your personal life, at school, and as you start preparing for  your future career.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  course is an intermediate-level course that will lead you towards becoming  certified in Microsoft&reg; Word&reg;. When you complete INF2050: Word Processing 2 and  INF3060: Word Processing 3, you will have learned and practised the skills  required to become a Microsoft&reg; Word&reg; Certified Application Specialist, a highly  distinguished and well-known designation in all industries and corporations. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Ensure that you work carefully through the training rooms and let your teacher  know if you need help. You can repeat the training rooms until you are  comfortable with the skills being taught. If you have experience with word-processing  software, a review can help you discover alternative ways to perform tasks and teach  you shortcuts that will speed up your work. </p>
