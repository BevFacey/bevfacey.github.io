  <ul>
    <li>Use the built-in  and online Help functions.</li>
    <li>Access online resources  and demonstrations on the Internet.</li>
    <li>Join an online  learning community.</li>
  </ul>

From there, you can access training, demonstrations,  webcasts, podcasts, and information on how to become Microsoft&reg; Office&reg;  Certified.
