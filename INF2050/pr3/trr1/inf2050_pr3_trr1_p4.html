  <h3>Project 3: Documents for Personal and Business Use</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Compatibility with Other Software</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can save  your documents in different file formats to make them compatible with earlier  versions of Microsoft&reg; Word&reg; or other software programs, or even to convert them to web pages. You can also save documents in PDF (portable document file) format to preserve the data and the formatting of a document for publishing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr1/inf2050_mmpr3tr1.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Saving in Different Formats&rdquo; to  learn how to  convert files to different formats.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Security Tools</h5>

  </div>
  <p>When you are happy with the final draft of your  document, you can make your file &ldquo;read-only&rdquo; to prevent changes to the document. Click on the Office button, choose Prepare,  and select Mark as  Final. To edit a document that has been marked as final, you will need to repeat  the process but this time to unmark the file.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Labelling Your Work</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is important that your assignments are labelled if you intend  to print your work. Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr1/inf2050_mmpr3tr1.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Headers and Footers&rdquo; to learn how to use the header  or footer to insert your name, assignment name, and the date into your  documents.</p>
