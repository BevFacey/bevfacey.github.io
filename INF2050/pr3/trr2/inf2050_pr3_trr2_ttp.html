  <h4>Time to  Practise<br />
  </h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Don't forget to do the following as you work through this Time to Practise:<br />
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Study the  content, exemplars, graphics, and demonstrations presented in this training  session, and review the previous training sessions if necessary.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Keyword-search  the Help menu and online help references, such as Microsoft Online Help and  How-to, for additional software tips and training.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Practice 1</h5>
  <p> </p>
  <p>You never know when the perfect job opportunity is going to present  itself. Whether you are starting to think about getting a job, already have a  job, or haven’t given it much thought, preparing a cover letter is a valuable  exercise in taking stock of your assets. If you have already written a cover  letter, now is your chance to give it a second look, to update and improve it.  A cover letter is a work in progress that changes and develops as you gain more  skills and experience. Your cover letter should be updated regularly and should  be stored on your home computer as well as on a zip drive, memory stick, or a  back-up hard drive. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use the  Basic Competencies Checklist in Project 2 to help you evaluate and write about  your skills in your cover letter. Make note of skills you would like to develop  as you continue through this course.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right2blockColour">
    <p class="typewriter"><em><strong>Music City </strong></em>requires a part-time sales associate immediately. No  experience necessary. Please submit cover letter and resume to: Rita Ricardo,  Box 2356, Anytown, AB  T9J 2K3.</p>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Step 2—Scenario:</strong> You want to get a part-time job to earn extra money for a trip you  will be taking during spring break. Upon scanning the classified ads in your  local newspaper, you come across the following job. Use this job ad to create a  cover letter. If you are  applying for jobs at this time, you may  choose to write a cover letter for a job you may actually be considering (provide  the job ad if possible).</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>If you have already  prepared a cover letter, work from that document and make appropriate updates  and changes as necessary.<br />
    </li>
    <li>If you haven&rsquo;t  prepared a cover letter, use the exemplars provided or available Letter  templates to guide you in writing a cover letter.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Include all  appropriate letter parts.</p>
  <p><br />
  </p>
  <p>Use  full-block format and two-point punctuation style.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Spelling and  grammar check, and proofread your document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Save as &ldquo;Cover  Letter&rdquo; in your INF2050: WP 2: Letters folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Practice 2 </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Hooray—you got the job! Your new boss has discovered that you have word-processing skills and wants you to prepare a promotional letter to send to  Music City&rsquo;s preferred customers.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open  the file &ldquo;<a href="inf2050_pr3_trr2_pfrmlt.doc" target="_blank">Form Letter</a><span class="superscript">1</span>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Step  by Step Mail Merge Wizard to create a letter  from the current document. Select Type a new list of mailing recipients to Create  a new data source.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Customize  the columns with the following fields. Delete unnecessary fields. Add the  following customer records.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <table width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2">

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Save  your address list as &ldquo;Address 1&rdquo; in your INF2050: WP 2: Letters folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> The content of the letter is already written, but  you will have to add the recipient information to your letter by replacing the  highlighted &ldquo;place holders&rdquo; with the fields you created in your data source (&ldquo;Address  1&rdquo;). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>HINT:</strong>  Make sure you  add the necessary spaces between your fields. An example of where you will need  to include spaces is between the &lt;&lt;Title&gt;&gt; and the  &lt;&lt;Last_Name&gt;&gt; of the salutation. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Preview your letter and make any necessary changes.  Ensure the spacing of the letter is correct.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Complete  the merge.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Edit  individual letters, and merge all of  your customer records.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Save  your merged letters as &ldquo;Letters1&rdquo; in  your INF2050: WP 2: Letters folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Practice 3</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now you’ll need to prepare envelopes to send the letters you created in  Practice 2. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open a  new document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Use the Step by Step Mail Merge Wizard to create Envelopes.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click Next to start your document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Set the envelope options to Size 10.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Type your return address for Music City in the top  left-hand corner of the envelope.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Select your recipients by browsing for your data  source, which has been saved as &ldquo;Address 1&rdquo; in your INF2050: WP 2: Letters  folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Arrange your envelope; place the Address Block in  the text box in the middle of the envelope.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Preview your envelopes.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Complete the merge.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Edit individual envelopes, and merge all of your records.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Save the file as &ldquo;Envelopes&rdquo; in your INF2050: WP 2:  Letters folder. </p>
