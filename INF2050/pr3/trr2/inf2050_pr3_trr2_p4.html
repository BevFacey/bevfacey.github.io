  <h3>Project 3: Documents for Personal and Business Use</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6>Business  Letters</h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Business  letters are standard documents in the workplace. Organizations use business  letters to seek or share information, make a request, or act as a permanent  record. Business letters are written in  a professional tone and must be  clear and concise. Business letters follow the same format as a personal  business letter but are usually printed on business letterhead that contains the organization&rsquo;s contact information and the corporate logo. If you are using  pre-printed letterhead stationery for your letter, you don’t need to include a  return address&mdash;the information is included in the letterhead. In that case,  the letter would begin with the date at approximately 2&quot; from the letterhead.</p>

  <p>For efficiency, business letters are commonly full-block-style with all letter parts aligned at the left margin. You may also see modified block-style letters where  the date, complimentary closing, and writer&rsquo;s identification are tabbed to  centre. Examine the sample <a href="inf2050_pr3_trr2_busexmmb.pdf" target="_blank">Arrow Industries</a> letter to see an example of a modified block-style  letter.<br />

  <p>In business,  time is money. The faster and better you work, the faster you&rsquo;ll climb up the  corporate ladder.</p>

Use the Quick Parts Tool to add saved Building Blocks to any  document you work  on.

You can use Mail Merge to create form  letters containing common information, as well as to individualize each letter  to meet a particular client’s needs. You can also use Mail Merge to quickly  create envelopes and labels for group mailings. </p>Mail
