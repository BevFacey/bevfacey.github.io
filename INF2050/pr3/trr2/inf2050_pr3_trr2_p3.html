  <h3>Project 3: Documents for Personal and Business Use</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Structure and Format of  Personal Business and Business Letters</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>INF1030: Word Processing 1 introduced you to the  personal letter, teaching you the parts of the letter as well as proper letter  format. Proper letter format and correct terminology are essential to business  communication. As you enter the workforce, you will need to demonstrate your  ability to communicate in a professional manner. At the end of this lesson, be  sure you are familiar the terminology, structure, and format of the letter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Most letters are written using full block style, which aligns all letter parts along the left margin.  This is the easiest, fastest, and most commonly used style of letter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Look at the exemplar to learn the format for a personal business letter. Pay close attention to</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the proper  terminology for the letter parts<br />
<br />
          </li>
<li>the spacing  between the letter parts<br />
<br />
          </li>
    <li>the punctuation  style
      <ul>
        <li>two-point punctuation (also known as standard punctuation) uses a colon ( : ) after the  salutation, and a comma ( , ) after the  complimentary closing<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>no-point punctuation (also known as open  punctuation) has no punctuation after the salutation or complimentary closing</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Read the text in the <a href="inf2050_pr3_trr2_01.pdf" target="_blank">Personal Business Letter&mdash;Sample Cover Letter</a> to learn  how to develop the content for a cover letter that gets results.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Letters start with the return address (this is the sender&rsquo;s address, and it starts at approximately 2&quot;  from the top of the page). To start your letter in the correct spot, you can</p>
  <ul><li>hit your Enter  key four times</li>
    <li>set your top  margin to 2&quot; </li>
    <li>vertical-centre  the text in the document (from top to bottom of the page)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To  learn how to vertical-centre your text from the top to the bottom of the page,  go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr2/inf2050_mmpr3tr2.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Vertical Centre a Document.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The return address includes the sender&rsquo;s street  address or mail box number, town or city, province, postal code, and sometimes  country. The sender&rsquo;s name may be included in the return address or, it can be  omitted as it appears in the writer&rsquo;s identification at the end of the letter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When writing out addresses, use the two-letter  abbreviation codes for provinces and territories in Canada, and for states if  the letter is going to the United States. Below is a reference table for the  two-letter Canadian abbreviations.</p>

  <p>Canadian postal codes are written in ANA NAN format (where &ldquo;A&rdquo; stands for alphabetic character  and &ldquo;N&rdquo; stands for number), for example T8N 2W1. The postal code is  separated by one space and a hyphen is not used.  </p>
  <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
  <p><strong>Following the return  address, hit the Enter key twice to leave one blank line between the return  address and the date.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The standard Canadian date  format is month, day, and year; for example, September 15, 2010. Do not abbreviate the name of the month, and be  sure to include a comma between the day and the year. If you use a date in  numerical format (e.g., 03/12/2010), you may confuse your reader. Does this  date mean March 12 or December 3? By writing out the month, you clearly  communicate the date.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr2/inf2050_mmpr3tr2.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Using the Insert Date and Time Feature&rdquo; to learn how Microsoft Word can automatically  insert the date for you.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>After the Date, Hit the  Enter Key 4–8 times, depending on the length of the letter (for short letters  use more spaces for better visual balance; for longer letters use fewer spaces  to create more room on the page for your content). </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After the 4<em>–</em>8 spaces, insert  the inside address. This is the name and complete address of the person  or business to whom you are sending the letter. If you are sending a letter to  an organization, it is always best to address the letter to a specific person  and include their job title or position if you can. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>After the inside address,  hit the Enter key two times to leave one blank line.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Next comes the salutation. When  you are sending a personal business letter, include your recipient's courtesy  title: Mr., Mrs., Ms., or Dr. If you don&rsquo;t know your recipient&rsquo;s name, you can  always phone the organization or search the company&rsquo;s website for a directory or  contact information. When contact information is unavailable, use &ldquo;Dear Ladies  and Gentlemen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear Personnel Director,&rdquo; or &ldquo;To Whom it May Concern.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After your salutation, you will need to choose a punctuation style for  the letter. </p>
  <p><br />
        </p>
  <p>Remember, two-point punctuation style uses a colon ( : ) after the salutation (e.g., Dear Mr. Boles:).  No-point punctuation style uses no punctuation (e.g., Dear Mr. Boles).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Following the salutation, hit the Enter key two times to leave one  blank line.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You may want to include a subject line. This is an optional line of text that summarizes the purpose of the  letter (e.g., SUBJECT: Letter of  application). The subject line can help the  reader focus his or her attention on the intent and purpose of your letter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Now hit the Enter key two times to leave one blank line.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The body of the letter usually has three paragraphs. The first paragraph introduces the  topic, and sets the letter’s tone; the second paragraph gives details, shares  information, or makes a request; the final paragraph closes the letter, gives  follow-up information, and concludes in a positive manner. Paragraphs are single-spaced,  aligned with the left margin, and separated by a blank line.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The length and content of the letter will be  determined by its purpose and what you need to communicate.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Once you have completed the body of your letter, hit the Enter key two  times to leave one blank line.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now it’s time to end your letter by adding the complimentary closing. The complimentary closing signals to the reader  that you are finished communicating, or ready to &ldquo;close&rdquo; the letter. Closings  may be formal (e.g., &ldquo;Respectfully,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cordially&rdquo;) or more personal (e.g.,  &ldquo;Sincerely&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yours truly&rdquo;).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Just as with the salutation, keep to one style of punctuation in the  complimentary closing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Two-point  punctuation style places a comma ( , )  after the closing (e.g., Sincerely,).</li>
    <li>No-point  punctuation style uses no punctuation (e.g., &ldquo;Sincerely&rdquo;).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Now hit the Enter key 4–8 times, depending on the length of the letter (use  more space for a short letter, and less space for a longer letter) so the  writer has enough space to handwrite his or her signature. </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The signature is handwritten by  the person sending the letter. The signature shows the reader you actually are  the author of the letter. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Below the signature, be sure to include the writer&rsquo;s  identification. This is the typed name of the  person sending the letter, including their job title if appropriate. The job  title can be typed following a comma after the writer's first and last name or  on the line directly below.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Hit the Enter key two times to leave one blank line if you are adding  notations.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Notations are used depending on the circumstances. Below are a  variety of notations that may be included in your letter. They are only to be  added if appropriate.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Typists initials</strong>. In business, office assistants will type letters  and prepare documents for other staff, and would therefore use typist initials  to identify themselves.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Enclosure</strong>. When you are sending your resum&eacute; with a cover  letter to apply for a job, you would use “Enclosure: Resum&eacute;,” indicating that  something else is accompanying the letter.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Carbon  copy (Cc)</strong>. You may have seen the carbon copy  option (&ldquo;Cc&rdquo;) in your email program. It is used when copies of the same letter  are being sent to two or more people (e.g., cc: Keith Wilson, Attorney). When  you use this notation on an email, everyone who is carbon copied can see the  list of people to whom the email was sent.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Blind carbon copy (Bcc)</strong>. The blind carbon copy notation is used when you  send copies of the same letter to people other than the addressee, but conceal  the complete list of recipients from the addressee. You may also use this  function to conceal all recipients&rsquo; names.</li>
