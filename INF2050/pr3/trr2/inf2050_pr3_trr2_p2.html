  <h5>Personal Business and Business Letters</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Every letter you write, personal or business, not only communicates  important information, but also creates an image of you or your business in the  mind of the reader. It is therefore essential to make sure that your letter is  perfect&mdash;that the message is clear and the information it contains is accurate&mdash;before you mail it. Use a professional tone and language in your writing, and  properly format your letter to create a positive impression.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To ensure positive results from your letters, always:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>use the  spelling and grammar check<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>proofread your  document, paying attention to the flow of your ideas and the accuracy of names,  dates, places, and numbers<br />
      <br />
          </li>
    <li>ask someone  else to proofread your work (a writer often doesn't notice his or her own  mistakes)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you are sure that the information you are sending is accurate,  complete, and free of errors, and that the format is correct, the letter is  ready to be mailed. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Personal Business Letters</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A personal business letter is written by an individual to an  organization, perhaps to apply for a job, request or share information, or  sometimes to make a complaint or seek a remedy to a situation. Personal  business letters use a more formal tone and language than do personal letters  to friends and family. A commonly used personal business letter is the cover  letter. The formatting and layout of your cover letter demonstrate your  knowledge and job skills to a potential employer, and have the ability to open  or close an employer&rsquo;s door at just a glance. Do you have a cover letter that  you are proud of?<br />
