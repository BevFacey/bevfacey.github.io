  <h4>Training Room 5: Tables</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Tables organize information into rows and  columns to display data in an easy-to-read format. Tables are excellent for  presenting essential facts and figures from your work so that your readers can quickly  focus on the information you wish to emphasize. You may have used a table to  create a personal phone list, or to record your science lab results for school.  In the work world, businesses use tables to analyze budgets, compare sales  figures, and report results to stakeholders.</p>
