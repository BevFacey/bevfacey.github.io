  <h5>Tables</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Remember that there are two ways to create a table in Microsoft Word:  by using tabs, and by using the Table feature. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Let’s review the basic table structure by studying the  following diagram:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This diagram shows the different tab stops you  can use to create a basic table.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_098_l.jpg" alt="This diagram shows left tab, center tab, right tab, decimal tab, and bar tab positions." width="633" height="394" /></p>
  <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can set tabs in two ways: by using the Tab  button on the ruler to select the appropriate tab (left, right, center,  decimal, bar):</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Or by using the Paragraph dialog box to access  the Tab window. Remember that the Paragraph tab is located on the Home tab inside  the Page Layout tab.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_100_l.jpg" alt="This diagram shows the Paragraph dialog box with the Tab button highlighted. " width="412" height="672" /></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now let&rsquo;s see how easy it is to convert text that  has been set up with tabs to a table. Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr5/inf2050_mmpr3tr5.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Text to Table.&rdquo;  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After you convert text to a table, you may need  to make some modifications. Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr5/inf2050_mmpr3tr5.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Modifications to Tables.&rdquo; You will see how to  merge cells and delete extra cells.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Sometimes you want to do the opposite and  convert a table to text. Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr5/inf2050_mmpr3tr5.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Table to Text&rdquo; to learn how to  convert a table to text using the Table Tools, Layout tab, Data group, and  selecting Convert to Text.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You may also need to adjust the size of the  cells and the table. Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr5/inf2050_mmpr3tr5.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Resizing Your Table&rdquo; to see how to adjust the  table manually using your mouse, as well as by using the Table Tools menu. You  can access Table Properties in the Table Tools menu as shown in the diagram, or  you can right-click on the table to bring up another menu of available options.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_101_l.jpg" alt="This diagram shows how to access Table properties using Table tools, the Layout tab, and the Cell Size dialog box launcher." width="633" height="558" /></p>
  <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can also change the position of the text in  the cell by using the Alignment group in the Layout tab. This diagram shows the  options available in the alignment group in the Layout menu.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_102_l.jpg" alt="This graphic shows the Alignment group in the Layout tab of the Table Tools menu." width="633" height="102" /></p>
  <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr5/inf2050_mmpr3tr5.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Text Alignment&rdquo; to see how easy it is to align  text to make your table look more balanced.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Want to totally change the look of your table? Change  the direction of the text in the cell using the Text Alignment button in the Alignment  group in the Layout tab.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_103_l.jpg" alt="This diagram shows the Text Direction button in the Alignment group, and text in the first column turned in a different direction." width="633" height="549" /></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A very helpful feature available in the Table function  is the Sort command, which is located in the Data group in the Layout tab in  Table Tools. You can use the command to sort the contents in a table by column,  or by text, number, or date. Look at the diagram to see the location of the Sort  command. Then go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr5/inf2050_mmpr3tr5.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Sorting Data in Your Table&rdquo; to see how the Sort functions will  reorganize the contents of your cell. Be sure when you sort cells to carefully  select the data you want to include in the sort.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Designing good-looking tables quickly is very  easy in Microsoft Word 2007. In the Design menu, there are many different built-in  Table Styles with automatic formatting for you to choose from. You can also  adjust the Table Style options to change where shading is applied.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr5/inf2050_mmpr3tr5.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Adding Shading and Styles to Your Table&rdquo; to learn how  to use the Tables Design tab tools to automatically apply built-in Table Styles  that allow you to add borders and shading to your document, and to see how  selecting different Table Style Options changes how the shading is applied.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can also create your own custom look for your table by applying Borders  and Shading. Have fun exploring the different border and shading options.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is one more way to create a Table in Microsoft  Word. Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr5/inf2050_mmpr3tr5.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Creating Tables&rdquo; to learn how to create a table using  the Draw Table feature.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For more help using this feature, use Microsoft  Word&rsquo;s built-in Help menus, or visit Microsoft Office Online Help and How-to  and keyword search &ldquo;Draw Table.&rdquo;</p>
