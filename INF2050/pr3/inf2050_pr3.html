  <p>Word processing is a basic skill that everyone  who uses a computer should possess. You will use word-processing skills in all  areas of your life — home, school, and as you enter the workforce. It’s time to  extend your word-processing skills beyond the basics and begin mastering the  many functions and capabilities of your word-processing software. In this  course, you will use software features and functions to easily produce  professional-looking documents faster than ever before. Whether you are writing  an application letter or preparing an English paper, INF2050: Word Processing  2 will help you develop industry-recognized workplace skills that employers  expect those entering the work force to have.</p>
