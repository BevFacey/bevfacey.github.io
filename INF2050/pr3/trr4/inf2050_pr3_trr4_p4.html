  <h3>Project 3: Documents for Personal and Business Use</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>The Report</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Headings and Subheadings </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Well-placed, descriptive headings and subheadings help organize the  body or content of a report in a logical manner, making the document easier to  read. Headings highlight particular sections of the report, while subheadings  are more specific to the individual ideas or topics covered in those sections. Using  headings and subheadings in your report not only helps you focus your writing,  but will also make your reports easier for your audience to read and understand. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Outlines and Document Maps</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Use headings and subheadings to create an outline of your report. You  can use the Outline view to organize your thoughts when you are ready to start  the writing process, or you can use this view to manage content you have  already written. It is important to note that the Outline View function is  different from the Numbered or Multilevel list functions we learned about  previously, and that these two functions serve different purposes and are not designed  to work together. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can access the Outline view in two ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using the Views buttons at the bottom right-hand  corner of your screen, beside the Zoom bar.<br />
        <br />
      <img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_060_l.jpg" alt="This screen shot shows the Outline button." width="298" height="21" /><br />
      <span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</span><br />
      <br />
    </li>
<li>In the View tab on the ribbon in Word 2007.<br />
        <br />
      <img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_061_l.jpg" alt="This screen shot shows the Outline button in the View tab on the ribbon." width="418" height="145" /><br />
        <span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</span><br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you are in the Outline view, you have  access to the Outlining tab to help you control the structure of content. Headings  and subheadings in your report are shown as Levels. In the Outlining tab, you  can change the level of importance of your headings by using the Promote and Demote  arrow buttons. There are nine levels of headings you can use. Level 1 is used  for main topics or headings. Use level 2 for subheadings.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_062_l.jpg" alt="This screen shot shows the Outlining tab." width="850" height="331" /></p>
  <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The content of your report is called the Body  Text. You can show or hide the content of your report by clicking the + button in  the margin to expand or collapse the body text.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_063_l.jpg" alt="This screen shot shows the heading expanded in the outline to show body text." width="646" height="240" /></p>
  <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr4/inf2050_mmpr3tr4.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;The Outline View&rdquo; to see how the  Outline view works.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you are in the View tab on the ribbon, you  can also access the Document Map. This tool helps you navigate lengthy  documents by displaying an outline of the headings used in a document in a  separate window pane. When you click on a heading in the Document Map window,  Microsoft Word jumps to that heading in your document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_064_l.jpg" alt="This screen shot shows the Document Map." width="851" height="481" /></p>
  <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can use the Outline view and the Document Map to easily move and  rearrange the content in your report to really speed up document editing: simply  select the heading and drag it to a new location in the report.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When your document is in the Print Layout view, you  can manage and format the content of your report quickly and easily using Styles.  The Print Layout View button is in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen,  or in the Document Views in the View tab on the ribbon.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_065_l.jpg" alt="This screen shot shows the Print Layout button." width="297" height="22" /></p>
  <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_066_l.jpg" alt="This screen shot shows the Print Layout button." width="458" height="146" /></p>
  <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Located in the Home tab, the Styles group helps  you build your documents quickly with galleries of coordinating Titles,  Headings, and Subheadings designed with document structure and formatting in  mind.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_067_l.jpg" alt="This screen shot shows the Styles group highlighted on the Ribbon." width="633" height="97" /></p>
  <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Each  Quick Style found in the Style Gallery is a  preset collection of formatting settings, such as font, colour, and size, that  you can apply with one click. Quick Styles help you build reports  using the proper components, such titles and headings, while making formatting  faster, easier, and more consistent (the same formatting characteristics are  applied each time you apply the style). You can even create your own style and  save it to the Quick Style gallery. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr4/inf2050_mmpr3tr4.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Styles Group&rdquo; to see how easy it is to use  the Styles feature to create a properly structured and professionally formatted  report.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr4/inf2050_mmpr3tr4.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Style Set, Colour, and Font Changes&rdquo; to see how quickly you can change the entire  look of a document using Styles.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you need more information about the styles  used in your document, you can use the Styles dialog box launcher to bring up  the Style pane. Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr4/inf2050_mmpr3tr4.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Style Pane&rdquo; to see how to access and use the Style pane  to see the formatting in a document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now that you  have done your writing and applied styles to your document, it is time to adjust  the layout of the report and add items such as references, title pages, and page  numbering to complete your project.</p>
