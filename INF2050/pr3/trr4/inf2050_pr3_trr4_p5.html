  <h5>Page Breaks</h5>

  <p>Word will  automatically insert a new page when there is enough text for more than one  page, but sometimes you will need to control where Word positions page breaks  in order to create a professional-looking document that is easy for the reader  to follow. There are several options for controlling when and where page breaks  occur. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can insert a page break when you want to break  pages in a particular location, or when you want to insert additional pages to  include items such as a bibliography or a title page. Before inserting a page  break, it is important to position your cursor where you want the break to  occur. To insert the page break, you can either use the Control + Enter command  on the keyboard, or you can use the Pages group in the Insert tab.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you insert a page break and turn on the Show/Hide  (&para;) function in the Home tab, you will see the non-printing symbol.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Sometimes page breaks will occur in bad  locations in a document, which can be confusing for your reader. When a break  happens within a paragraph and leaves a single line of text at either the top  or the bottom of the page, this is known as widows and orphans. A widow occurs when  the last line of a paragraph appears by itself at the top of the next page; an orphan  occurs when the first line of a paragraph appears by itself at the bottom of a  page. To control the way Word paginates a document, you can use the dialog box  launcher in the Paragraph group in the Home tab to access the Line and Page  Breaks menu. Use this menu to Control widows and orphans, or to keep lines and  paragraphs from separating.</p>

  <h5>Page Setup</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To create a 2&quot; margin on the first page of the report  and a 1&quot; margin on the second and succeeding pages of the report, go to the  Page Layout tab, Page Setup group, Margins command; and, on the second page of the  report, change the margin to 1&quot; and select Apply: from this point forward.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now that you  know how to create, format, and manage the content flow of a report, let&rsquo;s move  on to adding references to validate your research.<br />
