  <h5>Reveal Formatting </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>As you have  seen, different report styles use different formatting guidelines. For example,  MLA- and APA-style reports are formatted with one-inch margins and double  spacing. The Reveal Formatting feature of Microsoft Word 2007 will show you the  formatting codes used in a document. Use this feature to check that the  formatting for your report is done correctly according the specific style guide  used.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To use Reveal Formatting, you must add it to your  Quick Access Toolbar, use the Customize Quick Access Toolbar button, and select  All Commands to find the Reveal Formatting command as shown in the diagram  below.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr4/inf2050_mmpr3tr4.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Reveal Formatting&rdquo; to see how to add Reveal Formatting to your  Quick Access Toolbar.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you have added Reveal Formatting to your  Quick Access Toolbar, click the command button to see the Reveal Formatting  task pane. Notice the formatting of the font, paragraph, and page set up used  to create this document.</p>
