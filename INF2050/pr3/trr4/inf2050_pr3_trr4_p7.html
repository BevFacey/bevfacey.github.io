  <h5>Report Title Pages</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The title page comes at the very beginning of a report and is meant to  create interest, generate a first impression of the report, and provide  information, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the report&rsquo;s title (and  subtitle if there is one) <br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>the author’s  name<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>the name of the  course for which the report has been prepared, and the name of the teacher if  prepared for a particular class<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>the preparation  date of the report<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>complimentary  graphics relating to the report</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can use the Insert tab to have Microsoft Word 2007 create a cover  page for you. Simply position your cursor at the beginning of your report and  click the Cover Page button in the  Pages group for a built-in library of preformatted cover pages. You can also  design your own cover page using formatted text and graphics.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is a sample title page available in the built-in  library. Just click the placeholders and insert information pertinent to your report.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Table of Contents</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The table of contents, also known as the TOC, comes  before the report and provides an overview of the topics included. It helps the  reader locate information in the report by listing the headings and their  corresponding page numbers. If you created your report using Styles for your  headings and subheadings, Microsoft Word can save you time and automatically  create a table of contents. You can also use the Add Text command to insert  additional items in the TOC. To create a TOC, simply place your cursor at the  beginning of the report, insert a new page for the table of contents and click  the Table of Contents button to choose from a variety of built-in templates. If  you make any changes to your document, you must update your Table of Contents  to reflect your most recent changes using the Update Table button.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr4/inf2050_mmpr3tr4.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Create and Update a Table of Contents&rdquo; to see how to create  and update a table of contents by using the References tab on the ribbon. Remember,  it is important to position your cursor and insert a new page for your table of  contents.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Section Breaks </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Microsoft Word, you can use section breaks to separate  your report into different sections. It is important to separate the front  matter (the title page and the TOC) from the report in order to paginate and  format the different sections of the report properly. After creating the table  of contents, always insert a Next Page Section Break as shown in the diagram  below. You can access different types of breaks, including the Next Page  Section Break in the Page Layout tab, in the Page Setup group. Notice the Section  Break (Next Page) on the Table of Contents when you turn on the Show/Hide (&para;) function,  which indicates that  a new section and a new page has been created. When the report is  broken down by sections, you can customize settings, such as page numbering and  margins, for each section.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Index</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Another useful tool that you can utilize in creating your  report is the Index feature, which is also located in the Reference tab. An index  is found at the end of a document and lists terms and topics used in the report,  as well as the page that they appear on. To create an index, simply select the  desired text and then click the Mark Entry command, which will bring up the  Mark Index Entry window. Select Mark or Mark All if the same text is repeated  throughout the document. Complete this step for all of the text you would like  to include in the index. Insert a new page for the index, and click the Insert  Index command. Select a style you like best and then click OK. Remember, if you  add additional sources after you insert the index, always update your index by  clicking the Update Index button.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr4/inf2050_mmpr3tr4.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Creating an Index&rdquo; to see how easy it is to  use the Index group to mark entries and insert an index.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Headers, Footers, and Page Numbers</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Headers contain information that is repeated at the top of each page in  a document; footers contain information that is repeated at the bottom of each  page. Headers and footers are important in multi-page reports because they  often include information such as page numbering, the report’s submission date,  the author&rsquo;s name, and the report’s title.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can add headers, footers, and page numbers from  the Header and Footer group in the Insert tab on the ribbon.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_086_l.jpg" alt="This graphic shows how to insert page numbers in headers and footers." width="567" height="146" /></p>
  <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Number the pages of a report following the  diagram below. Remember, you used a section break after the TOC, separating the  report into sections, allowing you to number each section differently.</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_087_l.jpg" alt="This graphic shows the effects of page breaks on footers." width="633" height="216" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Look at the diagram below to see how to remove page numbers from the  title page and the first page of the report, and how to change the number  format to roman numerals on the table of contents.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr4/inf2050_mmpr3tr4.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Paginating a Report&rdquo; to learn how  to apply, format, and remove page numbers to different sections of the report.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you have inserted the page numbers properly, you can add additional  information to the header or footer, such as the date or the name of the  author. Click the Close Header and Footer button when you are finished adding  the header and footer information.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Previewing the Document</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The last thing you should do before you print any  document is preview it. Click the Office button and select Print. This will  bring up the Print Preview tab and allow you to print, adjust the page setup,  zoom, and preview the document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr4/inf2050_mmpr3tr4.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Previewing Document Options&rdquo; to learn how  to preview a document using scroll, zoom, and Print Preview.</p>
