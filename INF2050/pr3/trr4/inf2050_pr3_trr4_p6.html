  <div class="right2blockColour"><strong>plagiarism:</strong> to steal or pass off someone else&rsquo;s words or ideas as your own</div>
  <p>Often, it is necessary for a writer to use information, data, or ideas originating  with other sources. In fact, you are required by law to provide the source of  this information and acknowledge the original author(s) to avoid accusations of  <strong>plagiarism</strong>. The References tab in Microsoft Word 2007 has all the tools you  need to help you create and manage references in your report.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Citing references is done in several ways: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using in-text  citations</li>
    <li>Using footnotes  or endnotes </li>
    <li>Using bibliographies  or works cited pages and reference pages </li>
  </ul>
  <p>MLA format uses in-text citations to reference source  information, and Microsoft Word 2007 makes it easy to insert properly formatted  references. Simply choose the Style (MLA, APA, Chicago) in the Reference tab, Citations  &amp; Bibliography group, and click Insert Citation after your quotation. The Create  Source window appears for you to include as much information as you can to  build your entry. When you click OK, Word 2007 will automatically create and  format the citation for you according to the style you have chosen. If you change  the style of the report, Word 2007 will automatically reformat the citations  and the bibliography for you.</p>

  <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is an example of MLA style citation. Notice  that quotations longer than four lines need to be indented and single-spaced.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_075_l.jpg" alt="This graphic shows an in-text citation that is single-spaced and indented .5” on the left and .5” on the right. " width="668" height="280" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can control the line spacing and the  indentation in the Paragraph group in the Page Layout tab, and you can also  access the Paragraph group in the Home tab. This is the only group to appear  twice on the ribbon.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf2050_076_l.jpg" alt="This graphic shows the Paragraph group on the Page Layout tab on the ribbon." width="556" height="143" /></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The dialog box launcher accesses the Paragraph window  for even more control options.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Footnotes appear at the bottom of a page to  provide additional information about the source of your quotations, or  explanatory information about diagrams, figures, or statistics.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Endnotes are similar to footnotes, but they appear on a  separate page titled &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; at the end of the report, before the works cited page.  Endnotes are the publication recommended for MLA-style reports.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When footnotes and endnotes are  used to reference print resources in business reports, they include the name of  author(s), the title of the publication&rsquo;s name,  the publisher, date, and relevant page number. When  referencing online resources, include the title of the web page, the date accessed,  and the web address.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Use the Footnotes group in the References  tab to insert footnotes or endnotes. The Next Footnote command in the ribbon navigates  between footnotes in a document, and Show Notes scrolls the document so you can  see where the footnotes or endnotes are located. You can also use the Footnote  and Endnotes dialog box to format your notes, and easily convert footnotes to  endnotes and vice versa.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr4/inf2050_mmpr3tr4.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Citations and Footnotes in a Report&rdquo; to learn how  to insert citations and footnotes in Microsoft Word 2007.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A bibliography comes at the end  of the report and lists all of the reference materials used in the report&rsquo;s development.  MLA format uses a &ldquo;Works Cited&rdquo; page; APA format uses a &ldquo;References&rdquo; page. When  you use the Insert Citation command to reference your sources, Microsoft Word  can automatically build your bibliography  from the information you included when you created the source. To view a list  of the sources cited in the document, click on the Manage Sources  button. You can use the Style button to  choose the most common style formats, such as MLA or APA, and have Microsoft  Word 2007 properly format the citation according to that style. Finally, click  the Bibliography button and choose a  built-in, preformatted template to have Microsoft Word automatically create  your bibliography for you.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/inf2050_mmpr3tr4/inf2050_mmpr3tr4.htm" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and watch &ldquo;Creating a Bibliography&rdquo; to see how easy it is to  create a bibliography using Microsoft Word 2007.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now that you have included all your reference  information, let’s see how easy it is to use the software features in Microsoft  Word to automatically add a title page, a table of contents, and an index.</p>
