  <h5>More Helpful Tools</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Find, Replace, and Go To options in the Editing group  on the Home tab in the ribbon are helpful features that allow you to quickly search  and find information in your document. Use Find to search for word or a phrase  (if necessary, you can then Replace your text with another word).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Go To feature is a useful command for  navigating long documents quickly in a variety of ways. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Bookmarks  and Hyperlinks</h5>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Have  you ever started a document but knew you had to come back and make some edits  or revisions? Or have you ever wanted to link your report directly to a Web site  to provide more information for your reader? You can insert bookmarks and  hyperlinks from the Links group of the Insert tab on the ribbon.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>A bookmark allows you to &ldquo;mark&rdquo; a location or a  section of text, and name the selection for future reference. This is helpful  when you have a long document and want to find your marked location quickly. Simply  select the text or item you want to bookmark, or position your cursor, click Bookmark  in the Links group on the Insert tab, and in the Bookmark Name field, enter a  name and click Add. Bookmark Names must begin with a letter character and may  not include any spaces. Use the underscore to separate names (e.g., training_room).  To go to a specific bookmark, click the name or click Go To. You can delete a  bookmark here as well. You can also use Go To in the Find feature of the  Editing Group.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Also in the Links group is the Hyperlink button,  which allows you to link to another document or a Web address. Select the text  or a picture to be linked, click Hyperlink, and link within the file, to  another file, to a Web address, or to a new document.<br />
