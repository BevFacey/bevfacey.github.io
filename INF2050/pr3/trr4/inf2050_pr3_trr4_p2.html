  <h3>Project 3: Documents for Personal and Business Use</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Reports</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Reports are widely used documents in business and education. A report  is an organized document used to communicate ideas and facts about a specific  topic. There are different styles of reports, and the report&rsquo;s purpose and intended audience  will determine its length and format. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you are writing a report, the first step is to create a plan:</p>
  <ul><li>Define the  purpose of the report.
      <ul>
        <li>What is the  topic?</li>
        <li>How long does the  report have to be?</li>
        <li>What do you  want your reader to know?</li>
        <li>When is it due?<br />
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Determine the  audience.
      <ul>
        <li>How much  experience or knowledge does the reader have of the topic?</li>
        <li>How much detail  does your reader need in order to understand the topic?</li>
        <li>Is the audience  internal or external to your organization?<br />
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Determine ideas  to be included to focus your research.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Collect necessary  material, information, and data.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Organize the  data into the main ideas and subtopics.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Prepare an  outline of headings and subheadings. </li>
</ul>
<p>A report  typically has three sections:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Front  Matter
      <ul>
        <li>Title Page</li>
        <li>Table of  Contents<br />
          <br />
              </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Report
      <ul>
        <li>The introduction explains the purpose of the  report.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>The body provides facts and details that support the  main idea. (The body can be organized by headings or subheadings to make it  easier for the reader to follow.)<br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>The conclusion summarizes the report and may  provide recommendations.<br />
          <br />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The End Matter
      <ul>
        <li>Index</li>
        <li>Bibliography</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>You may encounter the following types of reports:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Informal reports give information, tell a story, or present an  opinion. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Formal reports give information about the study of a particular  topic and are written according to a specific style guide, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>MLA (Modern  Language Association)</li>
    <li>APA (American  Psychological Association)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Bound reports include a .75&quot; gutter on the left-hand side for  binding the final publication. In Microsoft Word 2007, you can adjust the  gutter setting by selecting the Page Layout tab on the ribbon, then, in the Page  Setup group, clicking on Custom Margins in the Margins command. </p>
  <p>  </p>
  <p>Unbound reports require no extra gutter for binding.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Review the following  examples of different  reports and their formatting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="inf2050_pr3_trr4_busexmp.pdf" target="_blank">Basic Reports for School or Business</a><br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><a href="inf2050_pr3_trr4_mlaexm.pdf" target="_blank">Reports for Humanities (English and Social  Studies) Using MLA Style</a> (most widely used for high school)<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><a href="inf2050_pr3_trr4_apaexm.pdf" target="_blank">Reports for Social Sciences (Psychology) Using APA  Style</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Study the following <a href="inf2050_pr3_trr4_repexem.pdf" target="_blank">Example of a Basic Business Report</a>  to learn the basic format and structure of a report.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>As you see in the examples, the reports look  very different depending on which style of formatting is used. It is important  to always check with your teacher as to his or her preferred style.</p>
