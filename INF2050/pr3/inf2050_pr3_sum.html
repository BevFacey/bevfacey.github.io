  <h3>Project 3: Documents for Personal and Business Use</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Project Summary</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you can use word-processing  software to produce professional-looking documents quickly and easily, you have  developed skills that you will use in all aspects of your life. Consider the  benefits of saving time while creating quality work. Think of how you will use  your skills in your personal life, in your other school subjects, and as you  enter post-secondary education or the workforce. Remember, you are also  developing skills that can lead you towards Microsoft Certification. People  with skills stand out&mdash;are you one of those people?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once you are confident in using the skills you have acquired in the training rooms and have demonstrated competency with the practice exercises, move on to your final project.  </p>
