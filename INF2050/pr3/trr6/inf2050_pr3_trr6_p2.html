  <h5>Track Changes</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When turned on, Track Changes will mark and highlight  any change you or others make to a document. When you add text, Track Changes  shows the text as coloured and underlined. When you delete text, you can still  see it, but it is marked as strikethrough so you can see exactly what  was deleted. You can access Track Changes and all its features in the Tracking group  in the Review tab on the ribbon in Microsoft Word 2007. Once you have turned on  Track Changes and edited a document, use the Changes group to navigate the  changes, and Accept or Reject the changes made.</p>
