  <h4>Time to Practise<br />
  </h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Practice  1</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Use Track Changes and add comments to edit the  letter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the file <a href="inf2050_pr3_trr6_prac1.doc" target="_blank">Edit Letter</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In the Review tab, in the Tracking group, select Final  Showing Markup, and turn on Track Changes.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Edit the  letter, making any changes you feel are necessary to improve it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add two  comments to the letter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Save the  letter as &ldquo;New Letter&rdquo; in your INF2050: WP 2: Reviewing folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> <strong>BONUS.</strong> If  possible, send the &ldquo;New Letter&rdquo; file to another person also taking INF2050:  Word Processing 2 (Keep in mind that you may need to explain the concept and steps to using Track  Changes and Comments). Ask that person to also edit the document and to add one comment, then send the document back  to you when he or she is finished editing. You may need to consult with your  teacher to find an editing buddy.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Practice 2</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Accept or Reject  changes made to the document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open &ldquo;New Letter&rdquo; from the INF2050: WP 2: Review folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make sure Final Showing Markup is turned on. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Use the Changes group to navigate and Accept or  Reject changes made to the original document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In the Comments group, navigate and Delete the  comments made in the document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Review the final document to ensure all of the tracked  changes have been made and the comments deleted. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Save the document as &ldquo;Final Letter&rdquo; in your INF2050: WP 2: Reviewing folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Practice 3</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Training Room 2 Cover Letter Edit</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the cover letter you saved in your INF2050:  Letters folder. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Save a copy of the letter as &ldquo;Cover Letter Edit&rdquo; in  your INF2050:  WP 2:Reviewing Folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Use track changes to edit your own letter or find  an editing buddy to edit and comment on your letter. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Review the edits, accepting or rejecting the  edits as necessary. Be sure to read the comments and then delete the comments  from your letter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Ready?</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Were you able to use Track Changes to make changes to the original  letter in Practice 1? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Were you able to navigate the changes in the document and Accept or  Reject the proposed changes?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Were you able to insert and delete comments in the document?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Did the  changes made to your cover letter improve  the quality of the letter?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Check  Point</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If possible, collaborate with someone to discuss  and compare the editing changes you have made to &ldquo;Final Letter.&rdquo; Were some of  the editing changes the same? What differences where there in how you edited  the letter? Having reviewed the letter with someone else, what further changes  would you make?<br />
