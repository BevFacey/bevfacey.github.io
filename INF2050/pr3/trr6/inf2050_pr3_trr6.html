  <h4>Training Room 6: Review and Secure Documents</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Before you hand in or publish word-processing documents, it is always  best to review and proofread your document to make sure it is as perfect as  possible. Asking someone else to review your work can be a great way to catch  errors, but you may not always agree with your reviewers’ suggested changes. Microsoft  Word allows you to the track the changes made to a document and accept or  reject the changes without losing your original material. You and your  reviewers can also add comments to a document in order to provide helpful,  explanatory notes without interfering with document text. </p>
