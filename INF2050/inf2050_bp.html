  <p>To  be successful in the work world, you need to have hard and soft skills. Hard  skills are technical skills related to your job, such as knowing how to create  a proper letter, that make you productive and efficient. Soft skills are what  make you a good employee: being a creative problem solver, a good team member,  a skilled communicator, and having a positive attitude. Soft skills are the  basic competencies you will practise throughout this module. Whether you’re  interested in a career in business, technology, health sciences, or trades, all  industries are increasingly in need of employees who possess strong soft and  hard skills, including computer skills.</p>

  <p>A professional portfolio of your work is a valuable tool  that can be used on job interviews to demonstrate your word-processing skills.  Be sure to keep both digital and print samples of your best work to build your  portfolio.<br />
