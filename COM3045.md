# COM3045: Vector Graphics 2

* Students build on knowledge and skills acquired in Vector Graphics 1 by using vector editing software to create advanced vector graphics.
* Prerequisite: [COM2045: Vector Graphics 1](COM2045.md)

## Assignment 1 - Create and Edit Vector Images

Create vector images using graphic applications such as Illustrator, Photoshop, or Inkscape.

1. set up document, considering:
        1. colour mode
        2. resolution
    2. draw and transform objects by:
        1. creating and applying pattern swatch
        2. using macros
    3. manage colour and transparency by:
        1. re-colouring and fine tuning the work
        2. exploring colour combinations using colour theory
        3. using appropriate tools to create, modify, save and apply colour gradients to objects
    4. use type tools by:
        1. formatting a story
        2. locating or replacing fonts inside a document
        3. applying hyphenation
    5. control effects, appearance and styles by using the colour-select tool to copy attributes between elements:
    6. build objects by:
        1. creating and using a symbol
        2. preparing and creating artwork by using variables
    7. work with images by:
        1. turning a bitmap image into a vector object
        2. managing assets
    8. prepare an image for print output by:
        1. flattening the image
        2. choosing the correct print options and creating custom print presets
        3. choosing the correct .pdf presets or customizing options

## Assignment 2 - Presentation

1. Present a selection of work completed in this course to an audience.
2. Based on feedback and reflection, give yoursef a rating on a scale of 1 to 4 for each of the following:
    1. how the elements and principles of design help facilitate good composition
    2. the technical and creative aspects of the work; e.g., quality, uniqueness
    3. areas of concern/difficulty (if applicable)
    4. meeting school and community standards; e.g., appropriate language
    5. the use of tools and equipment

## Competencies and Skills

You will also be evaluated on your basic competencies such as your ability to:

* identify short-term and long-term goals
* identify steps to achieve goals
* communicate
* manage information
* use numbers
* think and solve problems
* demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours
* be responsible
* be adaptable
* learn continuously
* work safely
* work with others
* participate in projects and tasks
* recognize and then analyze the opportunities and barriers in the immediate environment
* identify potential resources to minimize barriers and maximize opportunities
