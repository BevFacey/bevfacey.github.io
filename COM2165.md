# COM2165: Printing 2

* Students develop printing skills and create a finished product that demonstrates an ability to reproduce multicolour graphics for use on selected media; e.g., banners, signs, T-shirts, uniforms, posters, ceramics, plastics, decals.
* Prerequisite: [COM1165: Printing 1](COM1165.md)

## Assignments

### Printing

Reproduce multicolour graphics using two or more printing methods.

* prepare a layout using type and/or images suitable for printing reproduction by applying appropriate design elements and principles
* identify the printing or reproduction options available and suggest the most appropriate one for reproducing the designed layout
* select a printing/reproduction method and prepare master(s) for reproduction using that method
* place image colours accurately with the aid of registration marks/guides
* ensure proper adhesion to the media
* finish reproductions as required using appropriate equipment; e.g., curing, drying, trimming, collating, pad making, stitching
