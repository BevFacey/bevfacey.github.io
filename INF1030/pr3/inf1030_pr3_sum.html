  <h3>Project 3&mdash;Documents for Personal Use</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Project Summary</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you can  use word-processing software to produce professional-looking documents quickly  and easily, you have developed skills that you will use in all aspects of your  life. Consider the benefits of saving time while creating quality work. Think  of how you will use your skills in your personal life, in your other school  subjects, and as you enter post-secondary education or the workforce. People  with skills stand out. Be one of those people.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This course  is designed to honour the time it takes you to learn new skills. When you are comfortable  with the skills presented in the training rooms, move on to your final project.</p>
