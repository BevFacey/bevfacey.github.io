  <p>You have already spent many years in school, and chances are you have  worked with word-processing software throughout your schooling and on your home  computer. Many students feel that they are already skilled in word processing,  and don't see how they can benefit from a word-processing course. Word-processing  programs are some of the most widely used computer applications, but there might  be a lot you don’t know about them. This course will teach you how to use word-processing  software efficiently to produce many of the kinds of documents that you will  use in all aspects of your life. Mastering the power of word-processing  software will save you time and make your work look great. Think of the  benefits of doing your school assignments faster, and of the many uses of word  processing as you enter the workforce. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This course is the first of three courses that will lead you towards  becoming certified in Microsoft Word. When you complete INF3060: Word  Processing 3, you will have learned and practised all of the skills required to  become a Microsoft Word Certified Application Specialist, a highly  distinguished and well-known designation in all industries and corporations. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Let's  begin with some basic word-processing software skills before we move on to document  production. If you are new to word processing, ensure that you  carefully work through the training rooms and let your instructor know if you  need help. You can repeat the training rooms until you are comfortable with the  skills being taught. If you have experience with word-processing software, a  quick review of the basics may be beneficial—you might discover an alternative  way to perform a task, or learn shortcuts to speed up your work. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
