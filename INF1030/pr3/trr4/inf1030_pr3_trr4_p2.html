  <h3>Training Room 4&mdash;Reports</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Reports</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Reports are documents that present ideas and facts in a logical form so  that readers can understand presented information, form opinions, and make  decisions, if necessary.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The purpose of the report and the intended audience will determine the  report’s length and format. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Reports can provide information, tell a story, or present an opinion. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Formal reports give information about a particular topic and are  written according to a specific style guide, such as that of the Modern  Language Association (MLA) or the American Psychological Association (APA).  In the workplace, businesses use a variety of  formatting styles to reflect their corporate image and unique style of branding.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Lists and Outlines </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You have already learned how to create bulleted, numbered, and  multilevel lists in the graphics section of this module. Using lists and  outlines for report-writing will help you organize your thoughts in a  meaningful and logical way in order to begin the writing process. These lists can  guide your writing and ensure you discuss every point you want to make.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Here is an  example of an outline that will help you begin writing a report.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h5>Formatting  Business Reports </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After completing your outline and then writing your report,  you will format your report using a specific style. There are several formal  report styles for you to choose from, so select a style appropriate for the  purpose of your writing.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv45x31"><img src="../../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_linkto_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Click the links below to see examples of different report styles and  their formatting.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="inf1030_pr3_trr4_01.doc" target="_blank">Simple report for school or business</a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="inf1030_pr3_trr4_02.doc" target="_blank">Reports for humanities (English and Social Studies):  MLA </a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="inf1030_pr3_trr4_03.doc" target="_blank">Reports for Social Sciences (Psychology): APA</a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>As you probably noticed, reports can look very different depending on the  formatting style the author uses. It is important to always check with your teacher  or employer as to his or her preferred style. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the following examples and demonstrations, you will discover the  structure of a simple report, and then learn to apply formatting to enhance the look  of the report and highlight important information.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv45x31"><img src="../../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_linkto_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Study this example to learn the format and structure of a <a href="inf1030_pr3_trr4_04.doc" target="_blank">simple  business report</a>. <br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Training Room  2: Letters, you discovered how to set line spacing and text alignment using the  commands in the Paragraph group.   </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv45x31"><img src="../../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_tricks_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  Paragraph group is the only group that appears in two tabs, the Home tab and  the Page Layout tab.  </p>
  <p><br />
      <br />
  </p>
  <div class="left3block">
    <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf1030_037a_l.jpg" alt="This graphic shows the paragraph group in the Page Layout Tab on the Microsoft Word 2007 Ribbon. " width="445" height="89" /></p>

  </div>
  <p><br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Below are  two refresher demonstrations.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To review how to adjust line spacing options in your document, go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_04.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and select &ldquo;Line Spacing Options.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_04.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and select &ldquo;Text Alignment&rdquo; to review alignment options. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now, build your  software skills by learning how to use tabs and indents. To do so, go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_04.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and select &ldquo;Tabs and Indents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Headings and Subheadings </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Well-placed, descriptive headings and subheadings help organize the  body or content of a report in a logical manner, making the document easier to  read. Headings highlight particular sections of the report, while subheadings  are more specific to the individual ideas or topics covered in those sections. The  headings and subheadings in your report correspond to the topics and subtopics in  the outline of your report. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To learn how to use the formatting features in the font group to format headings and subheadings in a report, go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_04.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a>. Once there, select &ldquo;Formatting Headings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right2block">
    <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf1030_037c_l.jpg" alt="This graphic shows the Styles group in the Home tab on the Microsoft Word 2007 Ribbon." width="305" height="76" /></p>
    <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation. </span></p>
  </div>
  <p>Microsoft  Word 2007 has preformatted Quick Styles to make formatting your documents quick  and easy. In the Home tab, in the Styles group, you will find a library of predefined sets  of formats that include font, colour, size, and alignment decisions. Some of  these styles also include borders. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>See how easy it is to apply Quick Styles in your report by going to <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_04.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and selecting &ldquo;Using Quick Styles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <div class="right2block">
    <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf1030_037d_l.jpg" alt="This graphic shows the Change Styles command in the Styles group in the Home tab in the Microsoft Word 2007 Ribbon." width="305" height="76" /></p>
    <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation. </span></p>
  </div>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_04.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and select &ldquo;Change Styles.&rdquo; This demonstration will show you how to change the Quick Styles you have  used in your document using the Change Styles command.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Page Breaks</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right1block">
    <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf1030_038_l.jpg" alt="This graphic shows the Pages group in the Insert tab." width="160" height="142" /></p>
    <p><span class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation. </span></p>
  </div>
  <p>Word will  automatically insert a new page when there is enough text for more than one  page. You can also insert page breaks in a document manually by using Control +  Enter, or by using the Pages group on the Insert tab in the ribbon. This is  useful when you want to control where a new page is inserted in a document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_04.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and select &ldquo;Inserting Page Breaks.&rdquo; This  demonstration will show you how to use the Insert Page Break function  in Microsoft Word 2007.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Report Title Pages</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now that you know how to insert page breaks, you will be able to use a  similar function to create a title page for your report so that the entire  report can be saved in one file. The title page comes at the beginning of a  report and is meant to create interest, generate a first impression, and  provide information, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the report’s  title (and subtitle if there is one) <br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>the author’s  name<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>the name of the  course for which the report has been prepared and the name of the teacher if  prepared for a particular class<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>the preparation  date of the report<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>complementary  graphics relating to the report</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="icondiv45x31"><img src="../../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_linkto_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Look at the following link to see an example of a <a href="inf1030_pr3_trr4_05.doc" target="_blank">report title page</a><span class="superscript">1</span> that includes all necessary information.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can  create a report title page in a separate document, or by inserting a page break  to create a new page before your report begins. Keeping the entire report  together in one file is beneficial if you are submitting your report  electronically to your teacher. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Watch a demonstration on how to create a title page for your report, and insert and modify clip art to complement the title page. Go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_04.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and select &ldquo;Formatting a Title Page.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Go to <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_04.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and select &ldquo;Inserting a Graphic on the Title Page.&rdquo; This video will demonstrate how to insert a graphic from a file in a report title page. </p>

  <h5>Headers and Footers </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right3block">
    <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf1030_038a_l.jpg" alt="This graphic shows the Header and Footer group in the Insert tab on the Microsoft Word 2007 Ribbon.  " width="445" height="95" /></p>
    <p class="credit">Microsoft product screen shot(s) reprinted with permission from Microsoft Corporation.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Headers are inserted at the top of a page, footers are inserted at the  bottom. Both carry information about the document, such as page number, the  report’s submission date, the author’s name, and the title of the report. This  information is repeated on every page.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>To insert headers, footers, and page numbers in a document, go to the  Insert tab, then the Header and Footer group. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To learn how to insert page numbers in your report, go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_04.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and select &ldquo;Numbering Pages.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_04.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and select &ldquo;Page Numbering with a Title Page.&rdquo; This demonstration will show you how to insert pages in a report that has a title page. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once you  have formatted your report, you will want to preview it to make sure that all  formatting is in place. To learn how to preview a document using Scroll, Zoom, and Print Preview, go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_04.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a>. Once there, select &ldquo;Previewing Your Document.&rdquo;</p>
