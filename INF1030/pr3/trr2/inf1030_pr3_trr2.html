  <p>When you write letters and other correspondence, not only are you  sending important information, you are creating an image of yourself in the  eyes of the reader. Sometimes your correspondence is your only opportunity to make  an impression on your recipient. It is essential to ensure that your documents are  just right before you send or publish them. Inaccurate information, poor use of  language, or sloppy formatting could result in miscommunication or the reader’s  unfavorable impression of the sender. To avoid this situation, consider the following suggestions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the  spelling and grammar check.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>Proofread your  document, paying attention to the flow of ideas and the accuracy of names,  dates, and places.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>Ask someone else  to proofread your work — a writer often misses his or her own mistakes. If  finding someone else to proofread is difficult, you can also read your work out  loud. You can sometimes pick up on mistakes when you are concentrating on  saying your words instead of reading them.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you are sure the information you are sending is accurate and  complete, your text is error-free and the format is correct, the correspondence  is ready to be sent or published. By the end of this training room, you will  have the knowledge and skills to create high-quality letters and memos.</p>
