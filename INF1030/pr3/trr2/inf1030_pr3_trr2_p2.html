  <h4>Letters</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When and why have you sent or received a letter?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="left2block">

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You might have sent a letter  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to your grandmother, thanking her for the  birthday money she sent in the mail <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>to the  manufacturer of your new jeans when they fell apart after only three washes<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>when you saw  your ideal job advertised <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>to your city or  town council representative to express your frustration over an increase in  your local recreation centre’s entrance fees</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A letter is often a good choice when you need to communicate with friends  and family, businesses, or your community. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Creating a Letter</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Personal letters</strong> are to people you know. You might use a personal  letter to share information, send a thank you, invite someone to a gathering,  or perhaps express your sympathy. Personal letters have a friendlier, more  relaxed tone than business letters.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A <strong>personal business letter</strong> is  written by an individual to an organization, perhaps to apply for a job,  request or share information, or sometimes to make a complaint or seek a remedy  to a situation. Personal business letters use a more formal tone and language  than do personal letters.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Full-block-style letters</strong> are the easiest, fastest, and most commonly used  style of letter. All parts of the letter are aligned along the left margin. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You will now be led through a letter from top to bottom to discover the  necessary letter parts and formatting requirements.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Return Address</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Letters start with the return address — this is the sender's address and it starts approximately 2&quot;  from the top of the page. To start your letter in the correct spot, you can</p>
  <ul>
    <li>hit your enter  key 4 times <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>set your top  margin to 2” <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>vertical center  the text in the document (from top to bottom of the page)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To learn how to change margins to adjust the workspace of your document, go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_02.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and select &ldquo;Setting the Margins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_02.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and select &ldquo;Vertical Center a Document.&rdquo; This demonstration will show you how to vertical center your text from top to bottom of the page.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv45x31"><img src="../../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_examples_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Look at the following <a href="inf1030_pr3_trr2_07.pdf" target="_blank">example</a> to see a properly formatted personal business letter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the return address, include the sender's street address or box  number, town or city, province, and postal code. The sender's name can be  included in the return address, but it can also be omitted because it appears  in the writer's identification at the end of the letter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When writing out the address, use the two-letter abbreviation codes for  provinces and territories in Canada, or for states if your letter is going to  the United States. Below is a reference table for the two-letter Canadian  abbreviations.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Canadian postal codes are in <strong>ANA NAN</strong> format (where “A” stands for alphabetic character and &quot;N&quot;  stands for number) (e.g., T8N 2W1). The postal code is separated by one  space and a hyphen is not used. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In a  personal letter to friends and family, the return address is optional. The  return address adds an air of formality, so you may exclude this part of the  letter if sending correspondence to people you know. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In a personal business letter, the return address is always included.  Not only does this add to the formality, it is also a quick way to tell the  recipient of your letter where you can be contacted. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Following  the return address, hit the Enter key twice to leave one blank line between the  return address and the date.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Date</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The standard Canadian <strong>date</strong> format is month, day, and year; (for example, September 15, 2010). In your letters,  do not abbreviate the month and be sure to include a comma between the day and  the year. If you opt to use a date in numerical format, such as 03/12/10, you  may cause your reader to wonder if this date means February 12th, or  December 3rd. By writing out the month, you spare your reader this  confusion.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After the  date, hit the Enter key 4–8 times, depending on the length of the letter (for  short letters, use more spaces for better visual balance; for longer letters  use fewer spaces to create more room on the page for your content). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Inside Address </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After the 4–8 spaces, insert  the <strong>inside address</strong>. This is the name  and complete address of the person or business you are sending the letter to.  If you are sending a letter to an organization, it is always best to address  the letter to a specific person and include their job title or position if you  can. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After the  inside address, hit the Enter key 2 times to leave one blank line.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Salutation</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Next comes the <strong>salutation</strong>. In a  personal letter, you can use the recipient’s first name only. When you are  sending a personal business letter, include the recipient’s courtesy title  (Mr., Mrs., Ms., or Dr). If you don't know the recipient’s name, you can always  phone their organization or even search the company's Web site for a directory or  contact information. Use “Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,” “Dear Personnel  Director,” or “To Whom it May Concern” only when more specific contact  information is unavailable. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Depending on the punctuation style you are working with, there are two  ways you can punctuate the salutation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Two-point punctuation style places a colon ( : ) after the salutation,  (e.g., Dear Mr. Boles:). <br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>No-point punctuation styles uses <strong>no</strong> punctuation, (e.g., Dear Mr. Boles).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Following the salutation, hit the Enter key 2 times to leave one blank  line.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Subject Line</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you are preparing a personal business letter you may want to include  a <strong>subject line</strong>. This is an optional  line of text that summarizes the purpose of the letter. For example, <strong>SUBJECT:  Letter of Application</strong>.  The subject line can help the  reader focus his or her attention on the intent and purpose of your letter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now hit the Enter key 2 times to leave one blank line.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Body</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The<strong> body</strong> of the letter usually has three paragraphs. The first paragraph  introduces the topic of the letter and sets its tone. The second paragraph  gives details, shares information, or makes a request. The last paragraph  closes the letter, gives follow-up information, and concludes in a positive  manner. Paragraphs are  single-spaced, aligned with the left margin, and separated by a blank line. The  length and content of the letter will be determined by its purpose and what you  need to communicate<strong>. </strong> </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once you have completed the body of your letter, hit the Enter key 2  times to leave one blank line.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Closing</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now it is time to end the letter by adding the <strong>complimentary  closing</strong>. The complimentary closing signals to  the reader that you are finished communicating and you are ready to  &quot;close&quot; the letter. Closings may be formal (“Respectfully” or “Cordially”)  or more personal (“Sincerely” or “Yours truly”).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Just as with the salutation, keep to one style of punctuation in the  complimentary closing. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Two-point  punctuation styles place a comma after  the closing (“Sincerely,”).<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>No-point  punctuation styles use no punctuation  after the closing (“Sincerely”).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now hit the Enter key 4–8 times (depending on the length of the letter  — use more space for a short letter, and less space for a longer letter) so  that you have enough space to handwrite your signature. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Signature</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The <strong>signature</strong> is handwritten by  the person sending the letter. The signature shows the reader you actually are  the author of the letter. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Below the signature, be sure to include the <strong>writer's  identification</strong>. This is the typed name of the  person sending the letter, including their job title if appropriate. The job  title can be typed following a comma after the writer's first and last name or  on the line directly below.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Hit the Enter key 2 times to leave one blank line if you are adding notations.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Notations</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Notations</strong> are used depending on the circumstances. Below are a  variety of notations that may be included in your letter. They are only to be  added if appropriate.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Typists initials</strong>. In business, office assistants will type letters  and prepare documents for other staff, and would therefore use typist initials  to identify themselves.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Enclosure.</strong> When you are sending your resume with a cover  letter to apply for a job, you would use “Enclosure: Resume,” indicating that  something else is accompanying the letter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Carbon  copy.</strong> You may have seen the carbon copy option  (“cc”) in your email program. It is used when copies of the same letter are  being sent to two or more people (e.g., cc: Keith Wilson, Attorney). When you  use this notation on an email, everyone who is carbon copied can see the list  of people to whom the email was sent.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Memorandum</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A memorandum, also known as a memo, is a printed document, similar to  an email, that is used to communicate information within an organization.  Because the audience of a memo is within the same organization and the purpose  is general communication, the formality of addresses and greetings is  unnecessary. Memos, like emails, need to be clear and concise. There may be one  or more paragraphs of information, and point form can be used. Omit unnecessary  background information to keep the memo brief. Remember, the key is general  communication to a group or all staff of an organization.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv45x31"><img src="../../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_examples_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>It is easy to enhance the visual appeal of the memo and highlight  important information by formatting the font, style, size, and colour of the  text. In the example linked below, note how fonts are used to draw attention to  particular pieces. Also note how the spacing of the lines creates distinct  visual parts so that the <a href="inf1030_pr3_trr2_01.pdf" target="_blank">memo</a>'s purpose is easily identified and quickly read.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
