  <h4>Check Point</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Can you create bulleted,  numbered, and multilevel lists? Do your lists look like the examples in the  training room?<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Compare Poster  1 (the Lemonade Sale poster you created) to the <a href="inf1030_pr3_trr3_01.doc">exemplar</a><span class="superscript">1</span>. Have you included all  the necessary information, including appropriate graphics? Did you make any improvements  to your poster that made it better than the example?<br />
      <br />
    </li>
<li>Show Poster 2  to a friend, classmate, or your teacher for feedback, discuss the following points,  and then make any changes necessary to improve your document: <br />
        <br />
          <ul type="disc">
        <li>Does the text clearly  communicate important information or details? </li>
        <li>Do the graphics  and colours draw attention and enhance the message?  </li>
        <li>Is the layout of  the text and graphics visually appealing and well placed on the page?</li>
        <li>Are there any  suggestions for improvement? </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Use  the <a href="../../inf1030_sklscklst.doc" target="_blank">Software Skills Checklist</a> and check off which skills you are confident in  demonstrating.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Did you have difficulty with any learning concepts or software  features? If so, go back and review the information — you will use these skills  in the next training sessions and in the final project.</p>
