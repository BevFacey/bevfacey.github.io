  <h4>Bullets, Numbering,  and Multilevel Lists</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Bullets, numbers, and multilevel lists are used to organize and  highlight key information in point form so it is easy to understand and  remember. A multilevel list is a list that has indented subcategories, also  known as a nested list.</p>

  <p>Bullets, Numbering, and Multilevel list buttons are located on the Home  tab on the Ribbon. There are a few ways you can add bullets and numbers to your  document</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Click the <strong>Bullets</strong>  or <strong>Numbering</strong> button and type your text. Each time you press Enter, another bullet  or number will be added.  <br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Click on the  text you have already typed, click on the <strong>Bullets</strong> or <strong>Numbering</strong> buttons.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Start  <strong>bullets </strong>by typing an asterisk ( * ) and then  the Tab or Space key. Each time you press Enter, another bullet will be added.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Start  <strong>numbering</strong> by typing “1.” Then hit the Tab key or  the Space key. Each time you press Enter, the next number will be added.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Creating a Poster</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you create a poster or a display, you need to draw attention to a  message. To begin, focus on an element that will capture a passerby’s eye and  draw them in to your poster (a word, a picture, or even a colour). Once you  have the reader’s attention, focus on a clear, concise message that delivers your  key points. Avoid excessive text, which can overwhelm, confuse, and disinterest  the reader. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Designing a Poster  or Display</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="left1block">
    <p><img src="../../images/graphics/inf1030_033_l.jpg" width="160" height="160" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>When we first learn to read, we are taught to start at the top left  corner of the page and move right. Our eyes are trained to follow a Z pattern,  starting at the optical center (the upper-left  corner of the page). Knowing how your eye scans a page will help you decide  where to place your text and graphics. Think of what you want your reader to  see first, consider how the eye scans the page and makes connections between  the graphics and the text, and decide what you want the reader to remember as  they finish looking at the page.  A good  place for business logos and contact information is in the bottom-right corner  of the page. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Effective use of white space  (blank space with no text or graphics) can highlight information, as well as provide  a clean look.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Using graphics is one of the most effective ways to create an  interesting display. You know the saying “A picture is worth a thousand words”?  Be discerning and choose just the right graphic.  Use the Insert tab, Illustrations group to  add clip art or pictures saved from the internet, your digital camera, or  a scanner.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right2block"><img src="../../images/graphics/inf1030_034_l.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="180" /></div>
  <p>Text should be large enough to read at a distance —  if your readers can’t read the text quickly as they walk by, your poster won’t  get a second look. Sans serif fonts,  such as Arial and Helvetica, are easier to read than serif fonts, such as Times New Roman, because the letters  of the fonts don’t have the “serifs” — hooks or end strokes — that characterize  serif fonts. (If you have taken any French courses, remember that <em>sans</em> means without, so <em>sans serif</em> means without the hooks or  end strokes.) Use only one or two font styles for a more consistent look, and  adjust the spacing between the text to make it easier to read.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Use capital letters, bold, italics, colour, and lines to highlight the  main points of your poster, but use these features carefully&mdash;over-formatting a document makes it difficult for your audience to pick out what is  important.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Bullets and numbers make information stand out, drawing the eye to each  bullet or number marker in the text.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now watch a series of video demonstrations to learn how to use  Microsoft Word 2007 software features to create a poster.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>  
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_03.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and select &ldquo;WordArt.&rdquo; Here, you will learn how to both insert and format WordArt.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_03.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and select &ldquo;Insert Text box.&rdquo; After you've watched that demonstration, select &ldquo;Insert Text box part 2.&rdquo; These videos will teach you  how to insert a text box, format the text, change the font  (style, size, colour, bold, italic), and change the case features of Microsoft  Word 2007.&nbsp;<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To learn how to insert and format graphics in your documents, go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_03.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a>. Select &ldquo;Inserting Graphics&rdquo; to view a demonstration.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To create a visually appealing document, you may need to move and adjust the size of objects on your page. To learn how, go to the <a href="../../mm/trainingroom_03.swf" target="_blank">Instructional Videos</a> and select &ldquo;Adjusting Graphics.&rdquo;</p>
