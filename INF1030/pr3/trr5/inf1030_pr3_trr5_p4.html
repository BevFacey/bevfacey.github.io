  <p>Self-check each practice session against the answer keys provided. Your  assignments might show some variation depending on your formatting choices, such  as font or colour. Be sure that your practice tables demonstrate your knowledge  and understanding of the basic table structure and formatting taught in this training  room.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Check your Practice  1 table against the <a href="inf1030_pr3_trr5_p4_01.doc" target="_blank">Practice 1 answer key.</a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Check your Practice  2 against the  <a href="inf1030_pr3_trr5_p4_02.doc" target="_blank">Practice 2 answer key</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Check your  Practice 3 against the <a href="inf1030_pr3_trr5_p4_03.doc" target="_blank">Practice 3 sample</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>How do your  documents compare to the answer keys and exemplars?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are able  to easily create tables using both tabs and the table command, move on to the next  training session. <br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>If you had any  difficulty creating tables or have made three or more formatting or editing errors,  review the training session again, and check with your instructor for  assistance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use  the <a href="../../inf1030_sklscklst.doc" target="_blank">Software Skills Checklist</a> and check off which skills you are confident in  demonstrating.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Did you have  difficulty with any of the concepts or software features? If so, go back and  review the information as you will use these skills in the final project.</p>
