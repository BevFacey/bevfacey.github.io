  <h3>Project 3&mdash;Documents for Personal Use</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv45x31"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_projects_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>Creating professional-looking documents is a basic skill that will help  you in your personal life and as you enter the workforce. In your personal  life, you may need to write application letters, personal letters, or perhaps  customer complaint letters. For school you need to write term papers, research  projects, or even create school newspapers. In the work world, businesses  communicate using documents such as letters, reports, tables, brochures, and  newsletters, and expect employees entering the workforce to have the skills to  quickly prepare these documents and produce professional results.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>What Do I Need to Complete This Project?</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In order to be successful, you will need</p>
  <ul>
    <li>access to a  computer with word-processing software—all examples for this module are based  on Microsoft Office Word 2007<br />
      <br />
          </li>
    <li>a place to  create an INF1030: WP1 folder to save your work (discuss with your instructor as  to where to store this folder; e.g., on a network, in a folder, on a flash  drive, on your personal desktop)</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>What Do I Already Know?</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>You have  written and received letters, and can determine the differences between  personal and business communication.<br />
      <br />
          </li>

    <li>You have looked  at information presented in tables.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>What Do I Need To Do? </h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This project is made up of five training rooms:      </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Training Room  1: Microsoft Word Basics</li>
    <li>Training Room  2: Letters and Memos</li>
    <li>Training Room  3: Graphics</li>
    <li>Training Room  4: Reports</li>
    <li>Training Room  5: Tables</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These training rooms are designed to teach you the basic components of  common documents. Training rooms include the following  components: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>information on  when to use and how to produce documents you will use at home, school, and work<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>demonstrations that teach basic software commands specific to Microsoft Word 2007<br />
      <br />
          </li>
    <li>practice activities  to help you with concepts presented in training rooms<br />
      <br />
          </li>
    <li>opportunities to  assess your understanding of the concepts presented in the training rooms</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="icondiv45x31"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_clock_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>In order to help you plan and organize your time, suggested completion  times for each training room are listed below. Depending on your skill and  experience, you may work through some training rooms faster, and others may  take more time. Working through the training rooms efficiently will ensure that  you have enough time to complete the entire course. These are <em>suggested</em> time lines to help keep you on  track. </p>

  <h4>Checking My Work</h4>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Once you  have completed the training rooms, compare your practice activities to the  exemplars provided to determine whether or not you have a good understanding of  the concepts presented. Make sure to contact your instructor if you have  questions about this process.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Use the INF1030: Word Processing 1 Software Skills Checklist to  evaluate your level of understanding, and check off the skills that you are  able to demonstrate as you progress through the training rooms. You must be  competent in all software skills presented in the training rooms before  beginning your final project. Print or save a copy of  the <a href="../inf1030_sklscklst.doc" target="_blank">Software Skills Checklist</a> now.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can  repeat training rooms and demonstrations as necessary if you have difficulties  with the software or if your work differs from the exemplars. You can also  refer to Help menus and online references for software training and  demonstrations. If you have any problems, your instructor is there to help.</p>
