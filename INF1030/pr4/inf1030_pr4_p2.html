  <h5>Final Project 1: Letter</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Many  situations in life will require you to write letters. Think of a recent retail  or restaurant experience you have had and compose a well-written, properly  formatted letter about a product you purchased or the customer service you  received. Employees often receive bonuses as an incentive for creating a  positive customer experience. If your experience was negative or if you had  trouble with the product, companies interested in retaining your business  appreciate constructive criticism and occasionally offer a solution. </p>

      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Be creative but also use a business tone in your writing.<br />

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At this stage in your  life, you may be starting to think about your future and possible career paths  you may wish to take.

  <h5>Final Project 4: Table</h5>

  <p>Tables communicate a lot of information in a visual format that's easy  to read. In your daily life, you might already use tables, such as a school timetable or  a schedule for your personal life on which you might keep track of your  workdays and sports practices. In this part of your final assignment, you will create  a table of your high school timetable or personal schedule.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your table may  look like the following example and must include</p>
  <ul>
    <li>merged cells</li>
    <li>shading</li>
  </ul>
  <table border="1" align="center" cellpadding="05" cellspacing="02">
    <tr class="bgtable">
      <td width="529" colspan="4" align="center"><strong>TIMETABLE    for [Student’s Name]</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="79"><p>Period 1</p></td>
      <td width="108"><p>8:40 – 10:05</p></td>
