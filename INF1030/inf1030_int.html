  <p>Welcome to INF1030: Word Processing 1!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  is an introductory-level course that  requires no prerequisite modules or experience in word processing. The course  focuses on developing word-processing software skills by teaching you how to  create, format, edit, and produce commonly used documents, such as letters,  reports, and tables. As you work through the course, you will also learn how to  establish proper routines and practices to promote workstation safety and  security, and practise basic competencies (employability skills) to increase  your potential in the workforce. You will also have the opportunity to examine  your personal inventory of interests and values to make connections to possible  career pathways.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This course is designed using Microsoft Office Word 2007 on a PC, but activities  can be completed using previous versions of Microsoft Word or other available  word-processing programs. You are encouraged to use Keyword searches in Help menus  and online references to find software-specific demonstrations and tips to  assist you in completing the learning activities. Microsoft Office Online is a rich source of help, training, demos, and  quizzes to teach Microsoft programs. Remember that your teacher is also there  to guide and assist you. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>INF1030: Word Processing 1 begins to build your skills towards obtaining Microsoft  Office Certification. Students continuing on the path towards Microsoft  Certification should also complete INF2050: Word Processing 2 and INF3060: Word Processing 3. You should investigate Microsoft Certification possibilities  as you take other INF modules that use Microsoft software. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  </div>
  <p>By the end  of the course, you will be ready to complete your final project, which will  assess your document preparation skills. When you have successfully completed all of the  requirements for the course, including the final project, you will earn one  credit towards your high school diploma. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A  professional portfolio of your work is a valuable tool that can be used in job  interviews to demonstrate your word-processing skills. Discuss creating a  portfolio with your teacher.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h4>Real-World Connections </h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To  be successful in the work world, you need to have hard and soft skills. Hard  skills are technical skills related to your job, such as knowing how to create a  proper letter, that make you productive and efficient. Soft skills are what  make you a good employee: being a creative problem solver, a good team member, a  skilled communicator, and having a positive attitude. Soft skills are the basic  competencies you will practise throughout this module.  Whether you’re interested in a career in  business, technology, health sciences, or trades, all industries are  increasingly in need of employees who possess strong soft and hard skills,  including computer skills.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Industry Skills — Microsoft Certification </h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Microsoft  Corporation is recognized worldwide as the industry leader in desktop  productivity and IT software. Acquiring Microsoft credentials distinguishes  your skills in the job market, giving you a considerable advantage over the  competition. Microsoft Certification ensures that you have the technical skills  and the practical work experience necessary to confidently and successfully handle  the demands of a busy workplace.  Your  personal investment into the certification process will be recognized by your  peers, your customers and clients, and your employers as a demonstration of  your commitment to advancing your skills and to life-long learning.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>An IDC study  shows that 75% of all administrative employees are required to have either moderate or advanced Microsoft Office skills — make sure that you are qualified  for your next job role. (IDC, 2007)<br />

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Course  Folder </h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>While  working through this course, it is important to save all of your work as  evidence of your learning. Check with your teacher as to where to create a course  folder in which you can save your assignments. Instructions for creating  folders are included in Project 1: Workstation Routines.</p>
