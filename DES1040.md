# DES1040: 3-D Design 1

Students develop skills and techniques for 3-D design, by using tools, materials and processes common to 3-D design to complete a variety of project activities.

* Planning
  * Choose a robot design that you would like to create a (rough) model of. Examples include:
    * Assembly line robotic arms
    * Boston Dynamics robots (Spot, Stretch, Atlas)
    * Flippy the burger-flipping robot
    * Robot pets (e.g. AIBO)
    * Humanoid robots

* Design Brief
  * Describe the purpose of the robot you've chosen.
  * Include a statement about who owns the copyright for the robot design.
  * Create a sketch of the robot from two different angles and take a photo of your sketch.

* Prototype
  * Using prototyping materials such as paper, cardboard, paperclips, and tape (and other supplies as available), create a basic prototype of your chosen robot design. It does not need to be function, but it should be representative.
  * Show your prototype and design brief to another student to get their feedback.
  * Take photos of your prototype.

* Digital Design
  * Create a model of your robot, based on your plan, brief, prototype, and feedback. Again, it doesn't need to be a functional robot.
  * Take screenshots of your digital model from different angles.

Complete an [Employability Skills Self-Assessment](https://github.com/BevFacey/bevfacey.github.io/blob/main/Documents/EmployabiltySkillsRubric.pdf) and a [Personal Inventory Checklist](https://github.com/BevFacey/bevfacey.github.io/blob/main/Documents/PersonalInventoryChecklist.pdf).

Submit all of your digital files, preferably in a single document or slide deck.
