# DES1040: 3-D Design 1

Students develop skills and techniques for 3-D design, by using tools, materials and processes common to 3-D design to complete a variety of project activities.

## Assignment 1 - Planning and Design Brief

Choose a robot design that you would like to create a (rough) model of. Examples include:

* Assembly line robotic arms
* Boston Dynamics robots (Spot, Stretch, Atlas)
* Flippy the burger-flipping robot
* Robot pets (e.g. AIBO)
* Humanoid robots

Create a document or slide deck to:

* Describe the purpose of the robot you've chosen.
* Create a sketch of the robot from two different angles and take a photo of your sketch.
* Include a statement about who owns the copyright for the robot design. If it is your original creation, then you own the copyright.

## Assignment 2 - Prototype

Using prototyping materials such as paper, cardboard, paperclips, and tape (and other supplies as available), create a basic prototype of your chosen robot design.

* It does not need to be function, but it should be representative.
* Show your prototype and design brief to another student to get their feedback.
* Take photos of your prototype.


## Assignment 3 - Digital Design

Create a digital model of your robot, based on your plan, brief, prototype, and feedback using [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com), [Blender](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/blender-3-essential-training/introducing-blender-3-0-for-beginners?u=100056737), or other design software of your choice.

* Again, it doesn't need to be a functional robot.
* Take screenshots of your digital model from different angles.

## Assignment 4 - Job Skills Forms

Complete an [Employability Skills Self-Assessment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeg5oKGSpVoPOOobLzBy20qugNRzDVHIJ4GU4AR6stKZwMFeg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1608836029=DES1040) and a [Personal Inventory Checklist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOEdGul7Omr2ggimeQU-dwUKrWGPU9t52ocposyntKgm7Kjg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1721107223=DES1040).

## Outcomes

The student will:

1. identify and practise 3-D design techniques within the parameters of a design brief to appropriate scale; e.g., process, production and presentation
    1. use terminology associated with the techniques learned
    2. demonstrate various techniques to provide design solutions; e.g., packaging, garment, architectural model
2. identify and use tools and materials common to 3-D design; e.g., modelling software, foam core board, fabric, wood
    1. demonstrate basic skills using tools and materials
    2. select and use appropriate tools and materials as outlined in the design brief
    3. use and maintain tools and materials in a safe and appropriate manner
3. identify, select and use elements and principles of design in project activities
    1. identify the elements and principles of design and use them in the context of the techniques included in the design brief
    2. organize and apply the visual elements using selected strategies (e.g., consideration of aesthetics, trends and materials) in completing technical exercises and projects
4. use 3-D design techniques to solve simple design problems
    1. demonstrate techniques common to 3-D design by:
        1. brainstorming ideas
        2. manipulating forms and space
        3. practising basic modelling techniques
        4. relating materials and techniques
    2. prepare portfolio-ready product
    3. select and solve one or more 3-D design problems using the design process
5. produce and present a portfolio-ready drawing, image, model, rendering or animation
    1. present images or model for assessment
    2. maintain a design folder, journal or sketchbook as part of the portfolio of ongoing observational drawing activities
    3. explain intentions and decision making related to the application of elements and principles of design
6. identify copyright restrictions and permissions and put them into practice
7. demonstrate basic competencies
    1. demonstrate fundamental skills to:
    2. demonstrate personal management skills to:
8. demonstrate basic competencies
    1. demonstrate fundamental skills to:
        1. communicate
        2. manage information
        3. use numbers

    3. demonstrate teamwork skills to:
        1. work with others
        2. participate in projects and tasks
9. make personal connections to the cluster content and processes to inform possible pathway choices
    1. complete/update a personal inventory; e.g., interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning and experiences
    2. create a connection between a personal inventory and occupational choices
