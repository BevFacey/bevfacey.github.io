# COM1035: Graphics Tools

* Students are introduced to the basics of computer graphics (vector and raster), and graphic computer programs.
* Prerequisite: [COM1005: Visual Composition](COM1005.md)

## Assignment 1 - Theory

1. Explain the advantages of using [vector-based](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics) versus [raster-based](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) formats.
2. List three common raster graphic file formats.
3. List three common vector graphic file formats.

## Assignment 2 - Graphics Programs Tutorials

1. Spend at least two class periods exploring tutorials for [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/photoshop-2023-essential-training/welcome-to-photoshop-essential-training?u=100056737) or [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/).
2. Spend at least two class periods exploring tutorials for [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/illustrator-2023-essential-training/welcome-to-the-course?u=100056737) or [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/learn/tutorials/).

## Assignment 3 - Vector Logo

Recreate a logo, such as the school logo, as a vector graphic. Your vector version should look as much like the original as possible.

## Assignment 4 - Poster Project

Create a poster in Illustrator or Inkscape using graphics imported from Photoshop or GIMP. It must include:

1. A minimum of three images [from the internet](https://search.creativecommons.org/) (legally) or pictures you have taken.
    * Each graphic must be edited in Photoshop or GIMP and you must use a combined total of 10 different tools.
    * Be sure to keep a copy of each original picture to create a presentation or document showing before and after
2. A minimum of 5 shapes created in Illustrator or Inkscapte. You must apply appropriate use of color and gradients to your shapes as well.
3. A variety of text demonstrating different typography.

## Assignment 5 - Project Presentation

1. Show your project to an audience and ask for feedback.
2. Provide feedback to at least one other student.
3. Write an evaluation of your own work, including:
    1. how the elements and principles of design help facilitate good composition
    2. the technical and creative aspects of the work; e.g., quality, uniqueness
    3. areas of concern/difficulty (if applicable)
    4. meeting school and community standards; e.g., appropriate language
    5. the use of tools and equipment
