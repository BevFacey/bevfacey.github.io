# COM3035: Raster Graphics 2

* Students build on the knowledge and skills acquired in Raster Graphics 1 by using raster editing software to create advanced raster graphics.
* Prerequisite: [COM2035: Raster Graphics 1](COM2035.md)

## Assignment - Create and Edit Raster Images

1. set up a document, considering:
    1. bit size
    2. colour profile
    3. pixel aspect ratio
2. organize and manage image files using correct file conventions, including:
    1. compression methods
    2. colour support
    3. adding metadata to an image
3. correct, paint and retouch images by:
    1. correcting tonal range
    2. adjusting colour range
4. use a painting tool by creating, editing and using a custom brush
5. work with selections by:
    1. modifying selections
    2. previewing selections
6. create and use layers, explaining the use of layer comps and comparing to layer groups
7. work with masks and channels to:
    1. explain the use of channels
    2. create, view and edit channels
    3. differentiate between a layer mask and a vector mask
    4. use a clipping mask
    5. convert to or from a selection, a channel and a mask
8. work with vector tools to:
    1. manage paths
    2. alter properties of type
9. automate tasks by:
    1. creating and using automated actions; e.g., batch action
    2. describing the difference between actions and scripting
    3. creating variables
10. manage colour by:
    1. discussing colour management issues and proper actions to take
    2. discussing the relationship between the colour gamut and rendering intents
11. create, edit and convert a high dynamic range (HDR) image
12. prepare an image for output by:
    1. explaining the relationship between the application and the print driver
    2. setting correct colour management options
    3. creating output for the Web and/or mobile devices
