# ELT1130: Robotics 1

Students apply the fundamentals of robotics systems and basic robotics functions.

## Safety Reminder

Robotics systems include moving parts and electrical power. Always:
* Keep fingers and hair away from motors and gears
* Power off robots before rewiring
* Secure robots before testing
* Follow all lab safety rules
* Be aware of others working nearby

## Theory

Answer the following questions on paper.

1. Identify and explain the main subsystems of a robot:
  * Power system
  * Controller (microcontroller or processor)
  * Sensors
  * Actuators
  * Structure/chassis
2. Describe how sensors provide inputs to a robot.
3. Explain how a controller processes these inputs.
4. Describe how actuators create outputs.
5. Draw a block diagram showing signal flow in a simple robot.
6. Choose three different sensors commonly used in robotics (e.g., ultrasonic, line sensor, button, light sensor) and explain:
  * What each sensor measures
  * What kind of signal it produces
  * How the robot can use that information
7. How are DC motors different from servos?
8. Why motor drivers are needed between controllers and motors?
9. Explain what could happen if:
  * A motor stalls
  * A sensor is miswired
  * Power polarity is reversed
10. Identify two real-world robotic applications (industry, healthcare, transportation, exploration, etc.) and explain what sensors and actuators those robots likely use.

## Practice

### Robotic Arm Assembly

Work with a partner or individually.

1. Collect the required materials for assembling a robot arm.
2. Review the provided robot arm design files, parts, and assembly guide.
3. Identify each mechanical component:
  * Base
  * Shoulder joint
  * Elbow joint
  * Wrist joint
  * End effector (gripper)
4. Assemble the arm according to instructions.
5. Install servos in each joint and ensure:
  * Correct orientation
  * Secure mounting
  * Free movement without binding

### Power and Control Wiring

1. Identify:
  * Controller
  * External power supply (if required)
  * Servo signal, power, and ground connections
2. Connect each servo to the controller (directly or via a servo driver).
3. Label servo channels based on joint location.

### Joint Control

1. Write a program to move one servo at a time. Define:
  * Minimum angle
  * Maximum angle
  * Neutral (home) position
2. Record observed motion limits and adjust code as needed.

### Task Programming (Automation)

1. Choose one of the following tasks:
  * Stack two lightweight blocks
  * Pick up and place an object on a target
  * Move objects from one container to another
2. Break the task into steps and create a motion sequence chart or flow diagram.
3. Program the arm to execute the task automatically.
4. Test for repeatability.

### Sensor Integration

1. Add basic sensing to your robot arm system to improve control or safety. Choose one of the following:
  * button to start/stop motion
  * potentiometer to manually control a joint
  * limit switch to detect home position
  * distance sensor to prevent collisions

## Reflection

1. How does this robot arm resemble industrial automation systems?
2. What skills here apply to [CNC machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_numerical_control) or drones?
3. What was challenging?
4. What worked well?
2. Explain how the skills learned here prepare you for:
 * advanced robotics learning
 * future robotics or technology careers
