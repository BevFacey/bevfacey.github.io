# ELT1910: ELT Project A

Students develop project design and management skills to extend and enhance competencies and skills in other CTS courses through contexts that are personally relevant.

* Prerequisite: two ELT credits

## Plan

1. Decide which soldering kit to assemble (e.g. [DAOKI C51](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Set-Up-Time-and-Alarm-in-C51-4-Bits-Digital/)), or design your own circuit (e.g. [laser cut lamp](https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=laser+cut+lamp)).
2. Design and fabricate a custom case for your project (e.g. cardboard, [laser cut wood](https://www.makercase.com))
3. Document the process in an engineering journal.

## Create

1. Set up an engineering journal document.
2. Verify all kit components.
3. Lay out tools and safety gear.
4. Practice through-hole soldering on a practice board.
5. Solder your project, documenting the process with photos and descriptions.
6. Test and troubleshoot your project.
7. Measure your project and design the enclosure.
8. Select and obtain materials.
9. Fabricate the case, documenting the process.

## Documentation and Reflection

Your engineering journal should include:

1. bill of materials and tools used
2. step-by-step assembly photos and notes (so someone else could recreate the project)
3. photos of the completed project
4. evaluation of the final product:
  * Does it work?
  * Does it match up with the original goal?
  * What went well in the process?
  * What challenges did you experience?
  * How did safety protocols help?
  * What improvements could be made for next time?
5. Describe how this project relates to your interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning, and experiences.
6. Describe potential careers or occupational choices related to this project.

### Competencies and Skills

You will also be evaluated on your competencies such as your ability to:

* communicate
* manage information
* use numbers
* think and solve problems
* demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours
* be responsible
* be adaptable
* learn continuously
* work safely
* work with others
* participate in projects and tasks
