# DES1010: Sketch, Draw & Model

* Students are introduced to observational sketching, drawing and modelling, and to a selection of basic materials and tools and their uses. Students also develop skills that can be applied to the field of design.
* Prerequisite: None

## Assignment 1 - Sketch

Create a basic sketch of a real object e.g., human forms, natural and manufactured objects, artifacts from different materials with differing textures and reflective properties.

## Assignment 2 - Draw

Demonstrate various drawing styles used in different contexts; e.g., gesture, contour, tonal, isometric, perspective.

## Assignment 3 - Model

Demonstrate observational modelling to capture the essence of forms through easily manipulated materials; e.g., clay, paper, cardboard. Demonstrate the use of shape and form; e.g., flat shapes on surfaces, 3-D forms joined together to make new forms, 3-D forms in proximity to each other.

## Assignment 4 - Presentation

* Present a portfolio-ready drawing, rendering, or model that you created.
* Describe how this may connect to possible future careers.

## Outcomes

The student will:

1. sketch, draw and model natural and manufactured three-dimensional (3-D) forms
    1. draw real objects; e.g., human forms, natural and manufactured objects, artifacts from different materials with differing textures and reflective properties
    2. demonstrate various sketching and drawing styles used in different contexts; e.g., gesture, contour, tonal, isometric, perspective
    3. demonstrate observational modelling to capture the essence of forms through easily manipulated materials; e.g., clay, paper, cardboard
    4. demonstrate use of shape and form; e.g., flat shapes on surfaces, 3-D forms joined together to make new forms, 3-D forms in proximity to each other
2. use manual sketching, drawing and modelling materials and tools effectively
    1. recognize appropriate sketching, drawing and modelling tools
    2. demonstrate correct use and implementation of appropriate sketching, drawing and modelling tools and mediums; e.g., T-square, scales, set squares, pencil, chalk, coloured marker, ink, paint, paper, plastic, wood, foam
    3. use and maintain tools and materials in a safe and appropriate manner
    4. use appropriate scale
3. present a portfolio-ready drawing, rendering or model that the student produced
    1. present sketches, drawings and/or models for assessment
    2. maintain a design folder, journal or sketchbook as part of the portfolio of ongoing observational drawing and modelling activities
4. identify copyright restrictions and permissions and put them into practice
5. apply consistent and appropriate work station routines
    1. demonstrate good health and safety practices; e.g., posture, positioning of hardware and furniture
    2. demonstrate security for hardware, software, supplies and personal work
6. demonstrate basic competencies
    1. demonstrate fundamental skills to:
        1. communicate
        2. manage information
        3. use numbers
        4. think and solve problems
    2. demonstrate personal management skills to:
        1. demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours
        2. be responsible
        3. be adaptable
        4. learn continuously
        5. work safely
    3. demonstrate teamwork skills to:
        1. work with others
        2. participate in projects and tasks
7. make personal connections to the cluster content and processes to inform possible pathway choices
    1. complete/update a personal inventory; e.g., interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning and experiences
    2. create a connection between personal inventory and occupational choices
