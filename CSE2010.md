# CSE2010: Computer Science 2

Students explore hardware, software and processes at an intermediate level. Students extend their understanding of software development by learning how to layer modular programming approaches over structured programming techniques to improve the efficiency and robustness of algorithms and programs. They also are introduced to derived data types to provide them with data structures suitable for more demanding problems. Students add to their understanding of the hardware side of computer science by exploring a stylized von Neumann computer system at the machine level, and of the social side of computer science by examining some of the issues that have arisen from the implementation of computer technology.

1. Identify and describe past, present, and potential developments in computer technology:
  * analyze and explain the qualitative trends of the application of computer technology over time particularly the shift in focus, in the recent past, from traditional computation, information warehousing (databases), and automation and cybernetics to the present focus on communication, social and commercial networking, entertainment and artificial intelligence, and to a future focus on bionics and cyborganization and artificial life
  * analyze and explain the quantitative trends in the application of computer technology over time including the expansion, in the recent past, from the military, scientific community, government, and large and medium-sized institutions, to the present expansion into small institutions, the home, industrial and domestic machines and personal information managers, and to the projected expansion into personal expert systems, implanted systems and artificial life
  * identify and describe areas of ethical and moral concerns arising from the permeation of computer technology in society including:
    * privacy issues; e.g., data mining and database consolidation, tracking of financial transactions, e-mail and other communications monitoring
    * security issues; e.g., identity and information theft
