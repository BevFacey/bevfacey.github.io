# DES1020: The Design Process

Students develop an understanding of design problems through research and select, generate and evaluate possible solutions.

* 3D Design
  * You will be **designing** and **printing** your own 3D object examples could include a key fob, cookie cutters, pen holder, board game piece, terrarium decoration, or a replacement part for some larger device. For more *ideas* check out [Thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com), but don't simply download a model. Create a **design brief** (on paper or digitally) that includes:

    1. A description of the object you want to build and why you want to build it.
    1. A rough sketch of your object with dimensions (x, y, and z), preferably in millimeters.
    1. Why you are wanting to design this object and the purpose it will serve.

  * Submit your design brief document or a photo of it.
* 3D Modelling
  * Using your design brief as a guide, create a 3D model of your object.
  * If you have never used [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com), follow the [tutorials](https://www.tinkercad.com/3d-design) to get started.
  * If you prefer other 3D modelling programs such as [Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/products/sketchup-for-web) or [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/campaigns/education/fusion-360) feel free to use it.
  * Export your model as an [STL file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) for 3D printing.
* 3D Printing
  * Now that you have your STL file prepared, use the software on the 3D printer computers (or install it on your own computer) to slice your model for printing. Then follow the instructions to print your sliced file.
* Self-Evaluation
  * In a document or slide deck, write a self-evaluation that includes:
      1. Was the intention of your model successfully met?
      1. What worked well about your process?
      1. What could have gone better?
      1. What specific alternations or changes would you make that could enhance the quality of your model?
      1. Would this model be useful for others? Why or why not?
      1. What are two things your learned through this process?

Complete an [Employability Skills Self-Assessment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeg5oKGSpVoPOOobLzBy20qugNRzDVHIJ4GU4AR6stKZwMFeg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1608836029=DES1012) and a [Personal Inventory Checklist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOEdGul7Omr2ggimeQU-dwUKrWGPU9t52ocposyntKgm7Kjg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1721107223=DES1020).

Submit your design brief, your STL file, a photo of your 3D printed object, your self-evaluation, and your completed checklists.
