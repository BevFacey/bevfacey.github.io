# COM1025: Typography

* If there is no type on the page, it isn’t graphic design, it is fine art. Students learn about the power of typography and its uses in today’s world.
* Prerequisite: [COM1005: Visual Composition](COM1005.md)

## Assignment 1 - Typography Theory

1. Research and write or present about typography, including:
    1. the history of typography; e.g., origins, fads, trends, computing type, computer typesetting
    2. the role of typography in media; e.g., advertising, logo creation, identity, broadcasting, publishing
    3. examples of typography in multiple media; e.g., film, Web site design, advertising, print
    4. compare and contrast historical examples of typography

2. Write about and demonstrate the anatomy of a letter
    1. identify the anatomy of type: cap height, body, x-height, cross bar, terminal, counter, bowl, stroke, loop, ascender, baseline, descender
    2. demonstrate an understanding of the differences among the major typefaces:
        1. serif: e.g., Oldstyle—Caslon, Minion, Times, Bembo, Garamond; Modern—Onyx, Didot, Bodoni; e.g., Slab Serif—Clarendon, Memphis, New Century Schoolbook
        2. sans serif: e.g., Future, Today Sans, Formata, Trade Gothic
        3. display: e.g., Arcadia, Boulevard, Brush Script, Trajan
    3. describe the advantages and disadvantages of various typefaces for the user/designer
    4. explore the importance of each typeface; e.g., serif – easy to read, sans serif – clean and modern, display – attention getter
    5. describe what font family means
    6. create several pieces of text, using a different type of font for each to demonstrate the major typefaces and their appropriate uses

3. demonstrate an understanding of the elements of text
    1. describe kerning and tracking
    2. demonstrate line spacing and alignment
    3. describe stacked type and hierarchy
    4. visually represent the meaning of a word by adjusting the spacing, scale and position of letters on a page using only typography;

## Assignment 2 - Typography Project

Create a layout structure that is two or more pages.
    1. explore single-column versus multicolumn layouts
    2. articulate the need for a horizontal anchor
    3. explain modular grids
    4. position various texts within a modular grid and create variations to demonstrate the range of possibilities within a system
You may use generative AI to help create the text content.

## Assignment 3 - Project Presentation

1. Show your project to an audience and ask for feedback.
2. Provide feedback to at least one other student.
3. Write an evaluation of your own work, including:
    1. how the elements and principles of design help facilitate good composition
    2. the technical and creative aspects of the work; e.g., quality, uniqueness
    3. areas of concern/difficulty (if applicable)
    4. meeting school and community standards; e.g., appropriate language
    5. the use of tools and equipment
    6. how this might connect to future careers
