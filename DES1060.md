# DES1060: Technical Design & Drafting 1

* Students develop basic knowledge, skills and techniques to draft drawings for visualizing and illustrating simple design problems.
* Prerequisite: None

## Assignment 1 - Theory

Watch the following videos.

1. [Common Drawing Types](https://www.learnalberta.ca/content/ctmr/MovieResourceLauncher.htm?asset=movies/DES1060AE.mov) - 
2. [First and Third Angle Projections](https://www.learnalberta.ca/content/ctmr/MovieResourceLauncher.htm?asset=movies/DES1060BE.mov)
3. [Technical Drawing Applications](https://www.learnalberta.ca/content/ctmr/MovieResourceLauncher.htm?asset=movies/DES2050BE.mov)
4. [Dimensional and Orthographic Drawing](https://www.learnalberta.ca/content/ctmr/MovieResourceLauncher.htm?asset=movies/DES2050AE.mov)

Answer the following questions.

1. What are multi-view and orthographic drawings?
2. What is the difference between first angle projections and third angle projections?
3. Define each of the following:
    1. isometric drawing
    2. oblique drawing
    3. one-point perspective
    4. two-point perspective
4. How does CAD related to careers that you might be interested in?
5. What are some skills you have or need to develop in order to be successful at CAD?

## Assignment 2 - Draw a Manufactured Object

Draw a manufactured object that includes an illustrated detail; e.g., a hinge system on a box lid, a construction detail for a foundation, a pin to hold a wheel on an axle. Produce pictorial representations, surface developments, and renderings.

For that project produce a minimum of one of each of the following:

1. isometric drawing
2. oblique drawing (either cavalier or cabinet)
3. one-point and two-point perspective drawings
4. surface development for illustrating assembly; e.g., for a package, heating/ventilation duct, garment, exterior isometric

## Assignment 3 - Draw a Room

Draw a room, applying industry standards to annotations and dimensions and producing a minimum of one of each of the following:

1. orthographic
2. plan view
3. elevations; e.g., schematic, drawing

## Outcomes

The student will:

1. recognize multi-view drawings and pictorials  
    1. identify multi-view and orthographic drawings and their common views (e.g., front, top, side) and discriminate between first angle projections and third angle projections
    2. identify common pictorial drawing types; e.g., isometric, oblique, one- and two-point perspective
2. produce pictorial representations, surface developments and renderings  
    1. produce a minimum of one of each of the following within the context of assigned projects:
        1. isometric drawing
        2. oblique drawing (either cavalier or cabinet)
        3. one-point and two-point perspective drawings
        4. surface development for illustrating assembly; e.g., for a package, heating/ventilation duct, garment, exterior isometric
    2. draw a manufactured object that includes an illustrated detail; e.g., a hinge system on a box lid, a construction detail for a foundation, a pin to hold a wheel on an axle
3. produce multi-view drawings  
    1. produce a minimum of one of each of the following within the context of assigned projects:
        1. orthographic
        2. plan view
        3. elevations; e.g., schematic, drawing
    2. apply industry standards to annotations and dimensions
4. produce and present a portfolio-ready drawing, rendering or image
    1. apply industry standards to presentation copy
    2. submit presentation copy for assessment
    3. maintain a design folder that illustrates skill building
5. identify copyright restrictions and permissions and put them into practice
6. apply consistent and appropriate work station routines
    1. demonstrate good health and safety practices; e.g., posture, positioning of hardware and furniture
    2. demonstrate security for hardware, software, supplies and personal work
7. demonstrate basic competencies
    1. demonstrate fundamental skills to:
        1. communicate
        2. manage information
        3. use numbers
        4. think and solve problems
    2. demonstrate personal management skills to:
        1. demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours
        2. be responsible
        3. be adaptable
        4. learn continuously
        5. work safely
    3. demonstrate teamwork skills to:
        1. work with others
        2. participate in projects and tasks
8. make personal connections to the cluster content and processes to inform possible pathway choices
    1. complete/update a personal inventory; e.g., interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning and experiences
    2. create a connection between a personal inventory and occupational choices
