# CSE1220: Client-side Scripting 2

Students deepen their understanding of Internet computing by using more advanced markup language techniques and by being introduced to one or more Web-specific scripting languages. As part of this process, students learn how the Web uses these resources as a means of displaying dynamic client-side information. Students learn how to analyze, modify, write and debug algorithms and scripts that use structured programming approaches.

## Theory

1. Imagine you're visiting two websites. One looks the same every time you visit, while the other changes based on what you do. What are these websites called, and what makes them different?
2. How do websites that change based on user actions actually work behind the scenes?
3. Are there any downsides to using dynamic pages compared to websites that always look the same?
4. List some examples of using code to make parts of a website interactive.
5. Let's say you're creating a website. What steps would you take to plan out the pages, links, and how everything should look using forms and style sheets?
6. How have coding languages for websites changed and improved over time?
7. Pick two coding languages used for creating websites and briefly explain what they're good at and what kind of websites they're used for.

## Practical

Create a an interactive website that tells a story using [Twine](https://twinery.org/). Host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
