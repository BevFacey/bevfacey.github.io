  <h3>Project 1: Workstation Routines and Management</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Time  to Work</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_projects_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> This  project will take approximately 1.5 hours. The information from this project  should be practised throughout the course.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_assesment_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Before you begin, print and review a copy of the <a href="../inf2080_rub_wkstn.doc" target="_blank">Workstation Routines  Rubric</a>.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_direct_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>For this course you will need to set up a central  location to store documents you create. Watch the demonstration “<a href="../mm/inf2080_001/inf2080_001.htm" target="_blank">Creating a Folder on Your Desktop</a>” to learn how to create folders for INF2080: Spreadsheet  2. Check with your teacher as to where you will be saving your files.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Create a folder called “INF2080.” Then create a subfolder  within the INF2080 folder called &quot;SS2&quot;. Within the SS2 folder, create the following subfolders:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Project 1—Workstation  Routines and Management</li>
    <li>Project 2—Basic  Competencies </li>
    <li>Project  3—Spreadsheet Skills</li>
    <li>Project 4—Final Project</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_direct_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now, watch the following demonstrations  to learn how to open Microsoft Excel 2007 for the first time as well as how  to save your workbook. Make sure you save your work in the course folder you  created.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“<a href="../mm/inf2080_003/inf2080_003.htm" target="_blank">Opening Excel® for the First Time</a>”</li>
    <li>“<a href="../mm/inf2080_004/inf2080_004.htm" target="_blank">Saving a  Workbook</a>”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now, it’s  time to begin the project.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a new word processing document. Save  the file in the Project 1 folder and name it “Ergonomics.” </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_direct_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To review how to  open a word processing file, watch the demonstration “<a href="../mm/inf2080_005/inf2080_005.htm" target="_blank">Creating  and Saving a File</a>.”<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step  2:</strong> Add a header and/or footer to your file  that include your name, assignment name, and date. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_direct_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you are using Microsoft®  Word®, watch the demonstration “<a href="../mm/inf2080_006/inf2080_006.htm" target="_blank">Headers  and Footers</a>” to review formatting headers and footers.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Using the Internet, the glossary, or a dictionary,  look up the word <em>ergonomics</em> and write a definition in your own words in your  word processing document. Save your Ergonomics document.</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_linkto_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now that you know  what ergonomics is, take some time to read the information in the <a href="inf2080_pr1_p2_01.html" target="_blank">Workstation  Ergonomics</a> document. Do you have anything to add to your  definition of <em>ergonomics</em>? If so, open  your document and make the changes. Then resave the document.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Watch the &quot;<a href="../mm/inf2080_007/inf2080_007.html" target="_blank">Ergonomics</a>&quot; video.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Study the following diagram on arranging a work  surface. It is important to ensure that you, too, have a clean, well-organized  area in which to work.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../images/graphics/inf2080_023_l.jpg" alt="Two illustrations showing how to arrange a work surface. The first arrangement shows a reference manual to the left of the keyboard, a document holder directly in front of the keyboard, and the computer monitor to the right of the document holder. The second arrangement shows only a computer monitor directly in front of the keyboard." width="633" height="360" /></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is your  opportunity to improve your computer workstation. Using the information and  routines you have been given, make appropriate adjustments to your furniture,  equipment, and resources. If you have access to a camera, take before and after  pictures.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Answer the following questions in your Ergonomics document.</p>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>How many changes did you make?<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>What corrections were you not able to make  because of inadequate furniture, accessories, or lab restrictions?</li>
  </ol>
  <ol start="4">
    <li>What does practising good ergonomics and  setting up an efficient, safe, and organized workstation mean to you?<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>How can making this practice a habit help you  in the long run both personally and as you enter into the workforce?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Resave your document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right1block">
    <p><img src="../images/graphics/inf2080_024_l.jpg" alt="Female office worker doing stretching exercises" width="160" height="304" /></p>
    <p class="credit">© Juriah Mosin/shutterstock</p>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Make stretching a part of your routine. Practise  the exercises you have been shown every 30 min. Be sure to exercise your  shoulders, back, neck, wrists, fingers, and arms.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_linkto_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong> Step 6:</strong> Read the  document <a href="inf2080_pr1_p2_02.html" target="_blank">Workstation  Security</a> for information regarding hardware and software  security and keeping your personal work secure.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ol start="6">
    <li>Answer  the following questions. You can use Internet search terms to perform some  research on these topics as well.
     <p>&nbsp;</p>  
      <ol type="a">
        <li>List three ways to protect your  equipment or secure your work.</li>
        <li>List three ways you can protect  your computer from viruses.</li>
      </ol>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
  <li>In  the Ergonomics document you created, comment on your areas of strength and  weakness. Set a goal to improve one or two areas you identified as needing  improvement. Here are a few examples of possible goals:
    <blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>I remember to  stretch every 30 min to help reduce muscle fatigue</li>
      <li>I save files  frequently as I work and backup important files regularly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Using the Workstations Routine Rubric,  complete a <span class="nowrap">self-evaluation</span> to identify areas that you may need to work on  throughout the module. Revisit the Workstation Routine Rubric periodically throughout  the course and self-evaluate your progress in making appropriate workstation  routines a daily habit.</p>
