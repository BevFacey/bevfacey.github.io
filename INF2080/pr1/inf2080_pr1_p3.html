  <p>Practising good workstation positions, routines, and security quickly  becomes a habit when you practise these skills and techniques every time you  sit at a computer. Using good routines and practices will make you more  productive and reduce the likelihood of injury; protecting your equipment and personal  work from loss or damage will also save you time, money, and frustration.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Remember, continue to self-evaluate and reflect on your workstation  management and correct routines to obtain optimum health, safety, and security.  You will be evaluated on your workstation management by your teacher at the end  of the course.<br />
