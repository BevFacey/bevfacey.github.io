  <h3>Project 1: Workstation Routines and Management</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6>Workstation  Ergonomics</h6>
  <p><br />
  Information processing is enjoyable for many  people. Creating new documents, organizing data, designing graphics, solving  problems, and working faster can be fun and productive. However, like many other physical and mental  activities, working with computers can also be harmful if you don't follow good  routines and practices that protect both your health and your equipment.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>People have physical, mental, and social needs  at work, at school, as well as in their personal lives. Ergonomics is the study  of the impact that work and workspaces have on a person's needs and  capabilities. The term evolved from the  Greek words <em>ergo</em> (meaning “work”) and <em>nomos</em> (meaning “laws of”). There are now professions  that design jobs, worksites, learning stations, furniture, and equipment to  better suit people's requirements. These professions include occupational  health nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, home and office designers, health and  safety coordinators, and chiropractors. However, it is up to each individual to  take the time to modify and create the best workstations possible.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Repetitive Strain Injury—What Is It?</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Our bones and muscles make up our  musculoskeletal system. This system allows us to perform activities such as  walking, dancing, and swimming—<strong><em>plus </em></strong>everything else that requires  movement of the body. As strong as this system might be, overuse of the muscles  through repeated movements can put stress on your body, causing a <strong>Repetitive  Strain Injury </strong>(RSI). Other names for RSI include Cumulative Trauma Disorder  and Repetitive Motion Injury.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, many office jobs require that  we perform repetitive motions to fulfill our duties. For this reason, RSIs are  the most common type of injury found in the office. Tendons are common sites of  RSI pain and discomfort, but workers may also experience pain in other areas of  the body depending on the tasks performed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Symptoms of RSIs</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The first signs of an RSI may be subtle and  mild, and the symptoms may appear long after performing the activity. For these  reasons, people often ignore the slight aches and pains, but eventually these  slight aches and pains can become serious problems down the road if ignored.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Symptoms may include</p>
  <ul>
    <li>dull aching</li>
    <li>loss of sensation (numbness), especially at  night</li>
    <li>aches/pains, which may be worse at night</li>
    <li>tingling and burning sensations</li>
    <li>swelling around the wrist/hand</li>
    <li>dry, shiny palm</li>
    <li>‘pins and needles’ discomfort</li>
    <li>clumsiness (loss of ability to grasp items,  impaired thumb and finger dexterity)</li>
    <li>muscle weakness and fatigue</li>
    <li>muscle spasm</li>
    <li>joint restriction/loss of movement</li>
    <li>a ‘crackling’ feeling when swollen tendons  are pressed tightly</li>
    <li>a cyst-like swelling or node, known as a  ganglion, near a tendon or joint</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Although ergonomic principles can help us  ward off injury, we may be uninspired to implement them in our everyday habits  until our muscles and joints really start to hurt. <strong><em>Acknowledge the  warning signs as early as possible and do something about it.</em></strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Making Your Workstation Work for You</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We are all different. Some people have long  arms, others have short torsos, others have long legs—our differences are  endless, yet many of our workstations look exactly alike. If we spend several  hours a day at our workstations, why not make them fit us?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6><em>Your Chair</em></h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Since most office work is done sitting at a  desk, it is important to adjust our chairs to make them as comfortable as  possible.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6>How do I make my chair fit me?</h6>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Chair height. </strong>Adjust the height of  your chair so your thighs are horizontal and your knees are at right angles  when you are seated. (Or stand in front of the chair and adjust the height so  the highest point of the seat is just below your kneecap).<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Seat depth. </strong>The space between the  front edge of the seat and the back of your knee should be the span of two to  three fingers. This will minimize pressure on the underside of your leg.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Back support. </strong>Adjust the lumbar  support so it rests in the small of your back.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Armrests. </strong>While seated, bend your  elbows to 90 degrees and relax the shoulders. If your armrests do not allow for  this position, do not use them while keying or using the mouse. If armrests are  too high or too low, have them removed or get a new chair without armrests.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>When you’re sitting at your desk, consider  these points:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>THINK REST BREAKS.</strong><br />
  Remember that the body wasn’t designed to sit  in a chair for eight hours a day. Avoid sitting for long periods of time. Try  to alternate between sitting, standing, and walking while you work, or simply  get up and stretch. Aim to move your back, neck, and shoulders at least every 10  minutes, or try some of the office exercises included.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>THINK POSTURE.</strong><br />
  Keep your feet flat on the floor (using a  footrest, if necessary), and lean into the backrest at all times. Keep your  back in good alignment and your chin tucked in. This position should feel  comfortable and natural. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6><em>Your Work Surface</em></h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Imagine having the right chair perfectly  adjusted to your height, only to have the desk too tall for you. Having these  two elements mismatched makes for an ineffective workstation and poor ergonomic  design. Generally, the work surface should be about the height of the elbows  when the arms are hanging straight down while seated. If possible, adjust the height  of your desk or replace it with one that is suitable for your height.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../images/graphics/inf2080_012_l.jpg" width="222" height="169" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When customizing your work surface,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>THINK CONVENIENCE.</strong></p>
  <p>Overreaching above or below the shoulder  level can lead to aches and pains. Minimize the risk of injury by having the  items you frequently use close at hand. That may mean moving the telephone  closer to you or placing frequently used binders on your desk rather than on an  overhead shelf.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>THINK TIDY.</strong></p>
  <p>Your work surface should be free of clutter. Remove  unnecessary files and office supplies and have only what you need. Likewise,  your legs should be allowed to move freely underneath the desk. Gym bags, trash  cans, and boxes have no place under your desk.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6><em>Your Computer</em></h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Although you’ve adjusted your desk and chair  to fit you, you’re not quite finished adjusting your workstation. When  positioning your computer’s monitor, keyboard, and mouse, location is  everything.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6>Where do I place my monitor?</h6>
  <ol>
    <li>Position the monitor directly in front of  you when your head is in neutral position and your eyes are looking forward.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Adjust the screen height. Monitors should  be at eye level or just slightly below eye level.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Place your monitor 18” to 30” from your  eyes, or use the arm’s length rule: your monitor should be just beyond your  reach if you extend your arm directly in front of you. If the font is too  small, consider enlarging the font size. You should also consider adjusting your  monitor brightness and contrast for better viewing.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Here are a few other points you may want to  keep in mind about your monitor:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>GIVE YOUR EYES A BREAK.</strong></p>
  <p>Looking at a computer screen for extended  periods of time can cause eyestrain. For a few seconds every hour, focus on  something farther away (e.g., a clock 20 ft. away).<br />
    Tilt your monitor down if glare is noted on  the screen. If you find yourself tilting your head up to see the screen because  of bifocal or trifocal glasses (even after setting the monitor height), you may  want to consider computer-specific glasses. Eyestrain can also be caused by  uncorrected vision. Be sure to have your eyes regularly checked by a doctor.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6>Where do I place my mouse and keyboard?</h6>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Keyboard. </strong>Position your keyboard so  your wrists are straight when elbows are 90 degrees. Adjust your chair height or  your keyboard platform to do this.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mouse. </strong>Position the mouse at the  same height as the keyboard. Keep it within easy reach.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>When using your keyboard or mouse,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>THINK RELAXED.</strong></p>
  <p>Holding a mouse and typing on a keyboard  shouldn’t take too much effort. A light grip on the mouse and a light key  stroke will keep wrist pain to a minimum.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>THINK STRAIGHT.</strong></p>
  <p>Try to keep the wrist relaxed and straight.  Use the wrist/palm support for micro-breaks only; resting your hands or wrists  on the support during keying and mouse usage can bend the wrist. Also, keep  your elbows as close to the body as possible and move the mouse with the whole arm,  initiating movement from the shoulder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>It's all in the keys! </strong>When  possible, use the keyboard instead of the mouse to perform computer commands.  Learn the shortcuts for your operating system so you minimize wrist strain…and  boost productivity.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Think Activity</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h6>Office Exercises</h6>
  <p><br />
    Not only do proper diet and regular exercise  help strengthen our bodies and contribute to mental alertness, they also help  our bodies spring back from injury much faster.<br />
    Done frequently and properly, the following  exercises can help relieve joint and muscle tension and offset injury.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A few things to remember about doing exercises:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are under medical treatment, please  contact your physician before doing any of the following suggested exercises.</li>
    <li>Perform all exercises within your comfort  zone, and breathe naturally.</li>
    <li>Stretches should be done slowly and  smoothly. Do not bounce or strain. If you feel discomfort, STOP.<br />
    </li>
