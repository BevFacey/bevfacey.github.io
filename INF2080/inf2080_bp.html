  <p>How can spreadsheet skills advance your career?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Spreadsheets are complex tools companies use to  measure performances, plan budgets, and make important business decisions. If  you have spreadsheet skills, you can learn to manage and manipulate information  in the workplace. Spreadsheets can be used to maintain schedules, track  business expenses, track sales performances, and manage <span class="nowrap">large-scale</span> projects in  a variety of careers. Having a working knowledge of Microsoft® Excel® 2007 will  definitely add to the impressiveness of your r&eacute;sum&eacute; as you enter the world of  work.<br />
