  <h3>Project 2: Basic Competencies</h3>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> This project will take approximately 1.5 hours. The information and  insights discovered in this project should be practised throughout the course.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> With a partner, in a small group, or on a discussion  board, brainstorm a list of vital skills that relate to being successful. From  the list you create, determine which skills are necessary for a variety of areas,  such as school (secondary or post-secondary), on the job, or in your personal life. You can document your list in a new word  processing document on your computer. Be sure to save your list as Basic  Competencies in your INF2080 SS2 folder. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The following is a list of basic competencies deemed  necessary for this course and other CTS courses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fundamental  Skills<br />
    –  communicating<br />
    – managing information<br />
    – using numbers<br />
    – thinking and  problem solving<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li>Personal Management  Skills<br />
    – demonstrating  positive attitudes and behaviours<br />
    – being  responsible<br />
    – being  adaptable<br />
    – learning  continuously<br />
    – working  safely<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;Teamwork Skills<br />
    – working with  others<br />
    – participating  in projects and tasks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Compare  your list to the basic competencies listed in Step 1; then answer the questions  that follow  in your Basic Competencies document.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Are there  any skills under Fundamental, Personal Management, or Teamwork that you didn’t  mention in your list?<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Did you  think of any skills that were not covered in the three groups listed above?</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="icondiv63x63"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_assesment_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Print a copy of the <a href="../inf2080_rub_bc.doc" target="_blank">Basic  Competencies Rubric</a>. Complete a pre-course self-evaluation on your  basic competency skills.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Below  the list you created in Step 1, write a short paragraph about a time in your  life when you demonstrated basic competencies. Include work, school, or  personal life experiences in your paragraph. It would be beneficial to discuss  how the competency you identified impacted the example you provided.  Save the changes to your Basic Competencies  document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Choose  one or two competency areas in which you can make improvements. Write an action  statement of how you plan to practise the identified competencies. Identify the  benefits of practising the competencies. Here is one example:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="4%">&nbsp;</td>
      <td width="96%"><h6>Basic Competency: Manage  Information</h6>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Action Plan:</strong> Create and use suitable file names and organize  files in appropriate folders.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> I save time when I can easily find my documents.</p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Save the changes to your Basic Competencies  document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Checking Your Work</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Use the <a href="../inf2080_rub_bc.doc" target="_blank">Basic Competencies Rubric</a> as a self-check to  ensure that you are routinely thinking about using the basic competencies as  you work.</p>
