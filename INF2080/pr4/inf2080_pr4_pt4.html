  <p>For  this project you have been asked by your supervisor to use subtotals to  organize some insurance data. You also  must create a summary using LOOKUPs as well as a chart to present information.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Always remember that  you are to use all your knowledge of formatting and features in Excel to create the  most professional charts and data tables possible. This means you are to go  beyond the instructions in the assignment to create tables that have visual  appeal and are formatted in a manner that makes the information easy to read  and understand.</p>

  <p>Open the <a href="inf2080_pr4_pt4_01.xlsx" target="_blank">Insurance  Sales</a> spreadsheet. There are two worksheets: Sales and  Top Sales. You can keep your spreadsheet open on the screen while you  complete the following instructions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="credit">&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Instructions</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step  1:</strong> You have been  asked by your supervisor to subtotal the Sales worksheet. Add subtotals to each salesperson’s sales.  Then add a grand total. Use the Subtotal Function under the Data tab. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step  2:</strong> Once the subtotals  are complete, collapse the outline so that only the total sales for each  salesperson are showing.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step  3:</strong> Open the Top Sales  worksheet. Use the VLOOKUP function to bring the totals for each salesperson from  the Sales worksheet to the Top Sales worksheet. You will have to show all data on the Sales worksheet to do  this.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> On the Top Sales  worksheet, create a pie chart that shows the percentage each salesperson sold. Resize  the chart, if needed, so that all the percentages show. Apply formatting to the  chart as necessary. Ensure that the pie chart has an appropriate title.</p>
