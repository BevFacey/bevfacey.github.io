  <p>Before beginning the final project, make sure  you are confident in demonstrating all the skills on The Software Skills Checklist  to determine your readiness for final evaluation. Complete the Time to Reflect  portion of the Checklist; then hand it in to your teacher.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You  have learned some important skills in spreadsheets, and now it is time to  demonstrate your skills by using those skills to solve problems. Keep in mind  that you may use this final project to begin creating a professional portfolio  of your work to show to a potential employer or to help apply to attend a  post-secondary institution. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Discuss with your teacher a  method for submitting your final project: will it be presented in print or digitally?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What do I already know?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>By completing the five training room activities and the five Time to Practise  exercises, you have learned the necessary content and software skills to  complete the final projects.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What do I need to do?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a Final  Project folder in your INF2080 SS2 Folder, if you haven't already.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Complete each  of the five parts of the final project: French 20, Car Expense, Stocks, Insurance,  and Career Connections. There will be more details to follow.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>With your  teacher, discuss a method for submitting your final project to your teacher for  evaluation.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Re-evaluate  your workstation by completing the Workstation Routines Rubric, and submit it with  your final project.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Re-assess your soft  skills by completing the Basic Competencies Rubric, and submit it with your  final project.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This project will take approximately 4 hours.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Final  Project consists of five parts: Car Expense, French 20, Stocks, Insurance, and  Career Connections. In each part you will be provided a scenario and  instructions as to what you will need to do. Once all five parts are completed,  you will submit your Final Project to your teacher for assessment.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may have already  completed another CTS module; therefore, you may have already completed the  Career Connections assignment. If you have, check with your teacher about how  to proceed for Part 5: Career Connections.</p>
