  <p>Your  friend has decided to buy a used car. After taking the car for a test drive and  having a mechanic give it a thorough inspection, she is satisfied that this car  is safe. There’s just one decision she needs to make. She needs to decide  whether to pay the $11 000 asking price in one payment or take out a loan  and repay the loan in $3000 installments once a year for five years. She has  come to you for advice. The challenge, then, is to decide which option  is best for her—in other words, which one will give her the car for less money!</p>
