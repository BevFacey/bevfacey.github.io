  <h4>Project 4 Summary</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Project 4 required you to put together all of the skills you have learned throughout the course  and apply them to five different assignments.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Part 1 you  analyzed marks for French 20 and developed a professional-looking spreadsheet.  In Part 2 you went car shopping and crunched the numbers to make an informed  decision as to what rates, interest, and payments would work best for your  budget. In Part 3 you looked at stock quotes and had to make  recommendations to buy or sell stock. In Part 4 you applied the LOOKUP and  vLOOKUP functions for your supervisor to compare sales numbers in your  insurance firm. Finally, you completed the Career Connections assignment  to learn more about your goals, values, and skills.&nbsp; </p>
