  <h3>Project 4: Final Project</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Part 5: Career Connections</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At  this stage in your life you may be starting to think about your future and  possible career paths you may wish to take. Knowing what you are good at and  what you are interested in goes a long way to helping you make career  decisions. As you gain more life experience developing new skills, you will find  that you will start to re-assess your career decisions. Take some time to visit  the following website:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.alis.alberta.ca" target="_blank">http://www.alis.alberta.ca</a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Begin making your career connections. Explore the tab for High School  students at the top of the website where you will find the career planning  tools. In the self-assessment tools, take one of your personal skills and  attributes from your inventory and match them with appropriate career options.  Spend some time exploring this website.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Instructions</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step  1:</strong> Complete at least three of the ALIS Self-Assessment  Tools (http://www.alis.alberta.ca). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Search the ALIS site  for occupational profiles that match your personal inventory.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose three careers  that interest you.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Write a paragraph  linking your personal inventory and interests to possible occupational and  career choices. As you write, think  about the following questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What  did you discover about yourself from the self-assessments?<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Which  careers interest you? Provide brief descriptions.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>How  does your personal inventory connect to your career choices? Why are you  interested in or suited for this career?<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>What  do you see as positive aspects of the job? Are there negative aspects?</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> With a friend or  family member, discuss what you have discovered about how your values and  interests connect to your career choices. Do they have any advice for you?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Save your Career  Connection in your INF2080: Final Project folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Complete your  workstation and basic competencies rubrics. </p>
