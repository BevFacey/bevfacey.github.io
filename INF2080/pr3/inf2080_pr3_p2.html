  <p>Most of the time spent in  this course will be working through the five training rooms and the five Time  to Practise exercises.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To help plan your schedule, suggested completion  times for each training room (including the Time to Practise exercise) are as  follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Training  Room 1 (approx. 3 hours)</li>
    <li>Training  Room 2 (approx. 3 hours)</li>
    <li>Training  Room 3  (approx. 4 hours)</li>
    <li>Training  Room 4  (approx. 4 hours)</li>
    <li>Training  Room 5  (approx. 3 hours)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Depending on your skill and experience, you may work  through some training rooms faster than others. Efficiently  working through the training rooms will ensure that you have enough time to  complete this entire course.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Checking Your Work </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once you have completed the training rooms, complete the Time to  Practise exercises that accompany them. The Time to  Practise exercises are provided for you to practise the skills covered in the  training room. Make sure you contact your teacher if you have questions about  this process or need help completing any of the work.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Use the <a href="../inf2080_skilllscheck.doc" target="_blank">INF2080: Spreadsheet 2 Software Skills Checklist</a>   to evaluate your level of understanding. Check off the  skills you are able to demonstrate as you progress through the training rooms.  You must be competent in all software skills presented in the training rooms  before beginning the final project. Print or save a copy of the software  checklist now.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can repeat training rooms and demonstrations as  necessary if you encounter difficulties with the software or with the Time to  Practise exercises. You can also refer to Microsoft Help and online references  for software training and demonstrations. If you experience any road blocks,  contact your teacher for help and support.</p>
