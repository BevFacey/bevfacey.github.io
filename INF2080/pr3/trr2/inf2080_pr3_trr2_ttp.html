  <h5>Instructions</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this exercise you  will apply all of the knowledge and skills covered in Training Room 2.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Read through the  following instructions to see what you need to do to complete Time to Practise 2. You  can either print these instructions or you can have them open alongside the  Time to Practise 2 spreadsheet on your computer screen and work through them  simultaneously.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Complete the  following steps in order.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Open <a href="inf2080_pr3_trr2_ttp.xlsx" target="_blank">Time to  Practise 2</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Center the Heading &ldquo;Contact List&rdquo; across the width of the table. Apply the Accent2 cell style, and  change the font size to 20 point.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Use the Text to  Column Wizard to split the information in column B to Last Name and First Name. Remember  to insert a blank column before column C first.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Change the heading  in column B to &ldquo;LAST NAME,&rdquo; and add the heading &ldquo;FIRST NAME&rdquo; to column C.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Hide column A.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Hide the row  containing Ramid Marconi.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Change the column widths  so that all the information is showing.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Change the height of  row 5 to 30.00 (40 pixels).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Center the headings in  row 5 vertically and horizontally.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Insert a column  after the CITY column with the heading &ldquo;PROVINCE&rdquo;; then enter &ldquo;AB&rdquo; for each  entry. Center all the data horizontally in that column.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Apply the 60% -  Accent2 cell style to the headings in row 5.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Apply the 20% - Accent2  cell style to the rest of the data table.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Save the document as  Time to Practice 2 in your INF2080 SS2 folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Open the Software  Skills Checklist that you saved earlier and complete the chart for the skills you developed in this  training room.  </p>
