  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Instructions</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this exercise you  will apply all of the knowledge and skills covered in Training Room 1.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Read  through the following instructions to see what you need to do to complete Time  to Practise 1. You can either print these instructions or you can have them  open alongside the Time to Practise 1 spreadsheet on your computer screen and  work through them simultaneously.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Complete  the following steps in order:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Open <a href="inf2080_pr3_trr1_ttp.xlsx" target="_blank">Time to  Practise 1</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Change the name of the worksheet tab to the  current year (e.g., 2010)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the fill  handle, fill in the next four months across the top.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Using the fill  handle, fill in the totals in column I as well as the totals in rows 7, 13, 19,  and 25.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Bold the headings in  row 1 and change the font color.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Choose another font  color for the regions in column A and the cost categories (e.g., Labour) in  column B.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Bold and italicize all  calculated totals.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> In Page Break Preview  view, adjust the page breaks so that the first quarter&mdash;January, February, and  March—will be on page 1 and the second quarter costs will be on page 2. Then change  back to Normal view.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Freeze the top row  and scroll so that all the information rolls underneath the top row.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 10: </strong>Save the file as Time  to Practise 1 in your INF2080 SS2 folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 12: </strong>Open a template. If possible,  open the Holiday Shopping Planner from the Planners category in Microsoft  Office Online.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 13: </strong>Add five names of  people you wish to buy gifts for, and save your template as Holiday Planner in  your INF2080 SS2 folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Open the Software  Skills Checklist that you saved earlier and complete the chart for the skills you developed in this  training room. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Once you are finished and have saved your work, submit your Time to Practise 1 to your teacher for assessment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If needed, revisit  Training Room 1 to review any of the skills in which you had difficulties. If  you are confident in your skills and abilities, then move on to Training Room 2.</p>
