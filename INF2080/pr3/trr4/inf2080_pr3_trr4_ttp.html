  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Instructions</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this exercise you  will apply all of the knowledge and skills covered in Training Room 4. Read  through the following instructions to see what you need to do to complete Time  to Practise 4.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Complete the  following steps in order. You will create charts on  two separate worksheets: the Pie Chart worksheet and the Clustered Columnar  Chart worksheet.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Open <a href="inf2080_pr3_trr4_ttp.xlsx" target="_blank">Time to Practise 4</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On  the Pie Chart worksheet, complete these steps.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Create a pie chart of  the expenses for What a Wonderful World Travel. Do not include the Totals. Choose the type  of pie chart you like.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Title the pie chart &ldquo;Expenses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Portray the data labels  as percents. Go into Quick Layout to change their format in the Design tab.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Resize the chart  appropriately, and place it below the table.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Explode the pie piece  that depicts Advertising expense.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Format the background  appropriately.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On  the Clustered Columnar Chart worksheet, complete these steps:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 8: </strong>Create a 3-D Clustered  Column Chart for What a Wonderful World Travel that compares Brockhoff&rsquo;s,  Entrup&rsquo;s, and Clarkdale&rsquo;s information.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 9: </strong>Title the columnar  chart &ldquo;What a Wonderful World Travel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 10: </strong>Ensure that a legend  representing each salesperson is visible.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 11: </strong>Format the bars to  make them each a different color. Use the Quick Styles in the Design tab to do  this. Use Style 42.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 12: </strong>Format the labels for  Auto Rental, Air Fare, etc. to 10-point Arial bold.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 13: </strong>If needed, resize the  chart so the labels are easy to read.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 14: </strong>Turn off the  gridlines.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 15: </strong>Insert a graphic that  relates to the chart (e.g., something travel related). Position the graphic  appropriately.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 16: </strong>Save the document as  Time to Practise 4 in your INF2080 SS2 folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 17: </strong>Open your Software  Skills Checklist that you saved earlier and complete the chart for the skills you developed in this  training room. </p>

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If needed, revisit Training Room 4 to review any of the skills in which you had difficulties. If you are confident in your skills and abilities, then move on to Training Room 5.</p>
