  <h3>Orientation</h3>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Welcome to INF2080: Spreadsheet 2 Learn  EveryWare!</p>

  <p>This is an intermediate level course that will build on your knowledge  of spreadsheets and introduce you to more advanced spreadsheet skills. You will  review how to establish proper routines and practices that promote safety and  security, and you will practise basic competencies or employability skills as  you work through the course. You will  also examine your personal inventory (or interests and values) and make  connections to possible career pathways.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This course is designed using Microsoft® Excel®  2007 on a PC and will provide instructions for this software application. It is  important that you have Excel® 2007 on your computer. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Whenever you need Excel help, you can use the Help menu within the  software. You can also search the Internet for help. Microsoft Office Online is  a rich source of training, demos, podcasts, and webcasts that teaches you how  to use the software features. Remember, your teacher is also there to guide you  in the right direction. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Included in  this course are five training rooms. They provide instruction and allow you to  practise the skills needed to successfully complete the course. You are also  required to complete a Time to Practise exercise after each of the five training  rooms. These exercises allow you to demonstrate the application of the skills  learned.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At the end of this course you will be ready to  complete your final project, which will assess your skills in creating  spreadsheets to solve problems and to present information. Once you  successfully complete the final project and your skills assessments, you will  earn one credit towards your high school diploma.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To be successful in the work world, you need to  have hard and soft skills. Hard skills are technical skills related to your  job, such as knowing how to create a proper spreadsheet that use formulas and  that make you productive and efficient. Soft skills are the basic competencies  you will practise throughout this course. Soft skills are what make you a good  employee: having a positive attitude and being a creative problem solver, good team member, and skilled  communicator. Whether you are interested in a  career in business, technology, health sciences, or trades, industries are in  need of employees with strong computer skills.</p>
