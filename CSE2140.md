# CSE2140: Second Language Programming 1

Students who have mastered the basics of one programming language are given the opportunity to learn the basics of another. Designed for students who have learned how to write structured and/or modular programs in a more accessible programming environment, this course gives students an opportunity to develop a similar skill set in a more demanding language. In the process, they have a further opportunity to hone their structured and modular programming skills.

* Prerequisites: CSE2110: Procedural Programming 1 **or** CSE1120: Structured Programming 2

## Programming

Design and write a program in a language other than one you used for CSE2110 or CSE1120. Ensure that it includes:

* a plan, perhaps including pseudocode, before you start coding
* linked subprograms with a main or client module calling other modules
* functions (subprograms that return a value) or procedures (subprograms that do not return a value)
* local variables
* error-trapping techniques
* internal and external documentation

## Written / Recorded

1. Compare the two programming languages, including:
    * outlining the relative advantages and disadvantages of each
    * identifying and describing the process used by each language
    * language level of each (e.g. low, high, very high)
    * level of type (e.g. strongly typed, weakly typed)
    * relative difficulty to learn and write
    * programming resources and aids
    * types of subprograms supported by each
    * how modularity is supported by each
