# CSE1120: Structured Programming 2

Students work with structured programming constructs by adding the selection and iteration program control flow mechanisms to their programming repertoire. They write structured algorithms and programs that use blocks to introduce an element of modularity into their programming practice.

* Prerequisite: [CSE1110: Structured Programming 1](CSE1110.md)
