# CSE1120: Structured Programming 2

Students work with structured programming constructs by adding the selection and iteration program control flow mechanisms to their programming repertoire. They write structured algorithms and programs that use blocks to introduce an element of modularity into their programming practice.

* Prerequisite: CSE1110: Structured Programming 1

* Using a language of your choice, create a basic text-based game, such as [Rock paper scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors). Your game must include:
  * getting input from the player
  * processing the input
  * producing some output
  * variables
  * iteration or conditional statements
  * optional: single-player and multiplayer versions
* Post your source code file on GitHub (or another code sharing site) and submit the link in a document that also includes:
  * a paragraph about the process you went through in designing and writing your game.
    * Be sure to also include what went well and what could be improved.
  * a paragraph about how the knowledge and skills you are learning learning could relate to your future career choices.
