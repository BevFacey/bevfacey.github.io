# ELT3200: Robotics Artificial Intelligence

Students examine artificial intelligence in a robotics system.

* Prerequisite: ELT3170: Robotics Microprocessors

## Theory

1. Identify and describe how artificial intelligence can be used in a programmable robotics system

* define artificial intelligence with respect to robotics systems
* examine an existing artificial intelligence system (hardware and software) and report on the key components of the system including:
    * behaviour
    * movement strategies
    * task learning
    * sensor location
    * actuation feedback
    * exploration
    * research
* describe how artificial intelligence can be used in a robotics system to allow it to learn a task
* describe the effects artificial intelligence systems have on society with respect to:
    * law enforcement
    * military applications
    * disaster and/or accident response
    * medical
    * manufacturing

2. identify and describe knowledge acquisition strategies and implementation in programmable robotics systems

* identify and describe knowledge acquisition strategies in robotics systems including:
    * sensor type and input information
    * learned time-sequencing
    * sampling
    * maze analysis and learning
* identify and describe methodologies for task repeatability in a robotics system
* describe how a task can be accomplished in a robotics system without repeating the "search" pattern

## Practical

1. Design, build and program a robotics system incorporating artificial intelligence

* solve a design problem and build a programmable robotics system incorporating the solution
* build and program a robotics system that uses artificial intelligence to accomplish a specific task including:
    * sampling for learning a task/behaviour
    * repeating without sampling

* manage information
* use numbers
* think and solve problems
* demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours
* be responsible
* be adaptable
* learn continuously
* work safely
* work with others
* participate in projects and tasks
