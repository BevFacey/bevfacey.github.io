# CSE2110: Procedural Programming 1

Students develop their understanding of the procedural programming paradigm. They move from a structured programming approach in which modules were handled through the use of program blocks to a more formal modular programming approach in which they are handled through subprograms. In the process, students also learn to use a number of new design approaches made possible by the new paradigms. As part of this process, they also learn what types of problems are amenable to modular algorithms and programs.

* Prerequisite: CSE1120: Structured Programming 2

## Programming

Create a program that uses:

* modules and submodules (e.g., input submodules, processing submodules, and output submodules)
* both internal and external documentation

*You have two options for this, a game or a data science notebook.*

**Option A** - Create a game by following a tutorial using one of:

* [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/)
* [Python Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest)
* [Greenfoot (Java)](https://www.greenfoot.org)
* [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en/gamemaker)
* another (approved) platform or library

**Option B** - Create a data science notebook:

* Refer to these [Curriculum Notebooks](https://github.com/callysto/curriculum-notebooks), [Data Visualizations](https://github.com/callysto/data-viz-of-the-week), or [Interesting Problems](https://github.com/callysto/interesting-problems) for examples.

## Theory

Answer the following questions in a document, slide deck, or other (approved) method.

1. Describe the advantages of programming with modules or subroutines including:
    1. reducing the duplication of code in a program
    1. enabling the reuse of code in more than one program
    1. decomposing complex problems into simpler pieces to improve maintainability and extendibility
    1. improving the readability of a program
    1. hiding or protecting the program data

1. Select a programming environment/language and describe how it supports procedural programming including:
    1. the type of subprograms supported; e.g., procedures, functions, methods
    1. the level or type of modularity provided
    1. the level of protection provided from unwanted side-effects

1. Analyze and determine the type of scope required to protect and/or hide data and keep implementation decoupled from the calling modules and to avoid unwanted side-effects with consideration to:
    1. use of appropriate parameters for importing and exporting data to and from subprograms
    1. use of local variables and nested subprograms to enhance cohesion
    1. one- and two-way parameter passing for importing and exporting data to and from subprograms

## Self-Evaluation

Write or record how well you:

1. communicate
1. manage information
1. use numbers
1. think and solve problems
1. demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours
1. act responsibly
1. adapt to new situations
1. work safely
1. work with others
1. participate in projects and tasks
1. maximize opportunities
