# DES2045: 3-D Design 2

Students continue to develop skills and techniques for 3-D design by using tools, materials and processes common to 3-D design to complete a variety of project activities.

* Prerequisite: DES1040: 3-D Design 1

1. plan and produce solutions to 3-D design briefs

* select and use appropriate tools and materials as outlined in the design brief
* apply the design process to solve a 3-D design problem; e.g., software modelling, cutting, joining, bending, measuring
* use and maintain tools and materials in a safe and appropriate manner

2. incorporate the elements and principles of design to achieve the design solution

* apply techniques, tools, materials and other resources in design solution; e.g., tone, texture and colour, markers and paints, images, typeface, drawing, layout, measuring, notation, rendering, assembly drawing and correct use of tools
* use mathematical and/or scientific principles as they apply to design projects assigned; e.g., organization of visual space, measurement of internal space, borders, columns, use of scale
* experiment with one or more elements (e.g., colour, line, shape) and/or principles (e.g., rhythm, balance) to achieve desired effects

3. produce and present a portfolio-ready drawing, image or rendering

* participate in interim critiques; e.g., self, peer, instructor
* discuss intentions and decision making related to the application of elements and principles of design
* present images and/or model(s) for assessment
* maintain a design folder, journal or sketchbook as part of the portfolio of ongoing observational drawing activities that illustrates skill building

4. identify copyright restrictions and permissions and put them into practice
