# ELT3170: Robotics Microprocessors

Students compare central processing unit (CPU) architecture of programmable robotics engineered systems and interface with analog sensors.

* Prerequisites: ELT1140: Robotics Applications, CSE3120: Object Oriented Programming 1

## Theory

1. compare the internal architecture of various programmable robotics systems

* compare the difference in internal architecture between different robotics system microprocessors
* explain the differences between machine and assembly language and interpretive and compiler language
* explore the types of microprocessors used in at least three types of robotics systems

2. Analyze the engineering data of a programmable robotics system

* define the following terms:
    * microprocessor
    * input/output
    * instruction set
    * operand
    * mnemonic
    * opcode
    * data/address

* define and explain how the following are used in programming:
    * inherent, immediate and direct addressing
    * conditional and unconditional branching
    * stack operation/pointer, cascade, pop/push/pull instructions
    * subroutines
    * carry, negative, zero, overflow and flag operation

* explain the purpose of the following functional sections in a microprocessor:
    * input/output
    * accumulator
    * program counter
    * instruction decoder
    * controller
    * data register
    * address register
    * stack pointer
    * index pointer

* illustrate a block diagram of a microprocessor system showing its internal architecture
* define a machine cycle and explain how it impacts microprocessor programming
* explain how clock frequency affects microprocessor speed
* define how sensor input cycle relates to microprocessor speed
* describe the function of input interfacing
* explain how an analog input is interpreted by a microprocessor

3. Create a transitional strategy to accommodate personal changes and build personal values
* identify short-term and long-term goals
* identify steps to achieve goals

## Practical

1. Build and program a robot to accomplish specified tasks

* write and execute programs that use analog and/or digital input devices
* solve a design problem and build a programmed robotics system incorporating the solution
* program a robotics system using one digital input and calculate the machine cycles required for a programmed robotics system to complete a task given a digital input device
* program a robotics system using one analog input and calculate the machine cycles required for a programmed robotics system to complete a task given an analog input device
* program a robotics system using one analog input requiring an interface and calculate the machine cycles required for a programmed robotics system to complete a task
* build, program and verify the operation of a robotics system that uses at least one sensor interface to perform a specified task
