# ELT3180: Robotics Vision Systems

Students examine various types of vision in a programmable robotics system.

* Prerequisite: ELT2170: Robotics Sensor 2

1. describe the difference between active and passive vision sensors

1.1 describe the difference in vision types in robotics systems including:

1.1.1 differentiate between active and passive vision

1.1.2 describe at least three types of passive vision

1.1.3 describe at least three types of active vision

1.2 describe how each of the following could be used in a robotics vision system:

1.2.1 presence or absence of light

1.2.2 light intensity

1.2.3 night vision capabilities

1.2.4 distance away from an object

2. identify and describe how global positioning can be used for vision

2.1 describe global positioning

2.2 describe how the following devices are used to track locations:

2.2.1 compass sensor

2.2.2 motor feedback

2.2.3 gyroscopic sensor

2.3 describe a strategy for using global positioning systems (GPS) for robotics vision where actual GPS is used

3. identify and describe methodologies for object recognition

3.1 describe how a simulated GPS system can be integrated with visual sensors to allow a robotics system to navigate using:

3.1.1 shape

3.1.2 colour

3.1.3 heat signature

4. identify and describe methods for object avoidance

4.1 utilize robot footprint requirements to identify and describe object avoidance strategies including:

4.1.1 barriers

4.1.2 hazards

4.1.3 environment

5. design, build and program a passive vision robotics system

5.1 solve a design problem and build a programmed robotics system incorporating the solution

5.2 design, build and program a robotics system that uses at least two different passive vision devices to accomplish a specific task; the robotics system must have an interaction between inputs and outputs 

6. design, build and program an active vision robotics system

6.1 design, build and program a robotics system that uses at least one active vision device to accomplish a specified task; the robotics system must use the active vision device to interact with the environment

7. demonstrate established laboratory procedures and safe work practices

7.1 identify and follow laboratory safety procedures

7.2 be aware of potential damage to robotics systems due to voltage and current conditions

7.3 demonstrate proper safety procedures while working with robotics systems

Throughout the course you will also be evaluated on your basic competencies such as your ability to:

* communicate
* manage information
* use numbers
* think and solve problems
* demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours
* be responsible
* be adaptable
* learn continuously
* work safely
* work with others
* participate in projects and tasks

9. create a transitional strategy to accommodate personal changes and build personal values

9.1 identify short-term and long-term goals

9.2 identify steps to achieve goals
