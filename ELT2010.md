# ELT 2010: Electro-assembly 2

Students apply electro-assembly technology to manufacture circuit boards.

* Prerequisite: ELT1010: Electro-assembly 1

## Theory

1. Identify appropriate construction methods to fabricate a circuit board.

1. Research the benefits and drawbacks of prototype construction assembly methods.

1. Research illnesses caused by chemicals, solder, and flux used in prototype construction.

## Practical

1. Lay out and construct a simple electronic circuit, for example [Cylon Eye](https://www.thegeekpub.com/236454/arduino-knight-rider-leds-cylon-eye/), using a tool such as [TinkerCAD circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits).
    * Draw a schematic diagram using schematic symbols to represent electronic components.
    * Match actual components to schematic symbols.

1. Prototype your circuit on a breadboard.

1. Practise circuit board building and component installation.

1. Assemble your circuit using actual components and [perfboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfboard).

1. Identify and follow safe procedures while using solder, flux, and other chemicals.

1. Demonstrate appropriate safety techniques for prototype construction.

1. Evaluate the circuit using electronic instruments such as multimeters.

1. Demonstrate how to troubleshoot an electronic circuit board.
