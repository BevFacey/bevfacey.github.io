[CSE2140: Second Language Programming 1](CSE2140.md)

* Students who have mastered the basics of one programming language are given the opportunity to learn the basics of another. Designed for students who have learned how to write structured and/or modular programs in a more accessible programming environment, this course gives students an opportunity to develop a similar skill set in a more demanding language. In the process, they have a further opportunity to hone their structured and modular programming skills.
* Prerequisites: CSE2110: Procedural Programming 1 **or** CSE1120: Structured Programming 2

[INF1060: Spreadsheet 1](INF1060.md)

* Students develop skills in the proper use of spreadsheet software through general data manipulation and personal recordkeeping.
* Prerequisites: None

[CSE2120: Data Structures 1](CSE2120.md)

* Students learn how to design code and debug programs that use a set of data structures that can be used to handle lists of related data. Building on their knowledge of basic or primitive data types, they learn how to work with fundamental data structures such as the array and the record. As part of this process, they learn what types of problems benefit from the use of these types of data structures
* Prerequisite: CSE2110: Procedural Programming 1

[CSE2130: Files & File Structures 1](CSE2130.md)

* Students learn how to design, code and debug programs that use data files to store and retrieve data on secondary storage devices. Building on their knowledge of derived data structures, they learn how to use those structures to organize data for efficient file handling. As part of this process, they learn what types of problems benefit from the use of external files.
* Prerequisite: CSE2120: Data Structures 1

[CSE1220: Client-Side Scripting 2](CSE1220.md)

* Students deepen their understanding of Internet computing by using more advanced markup language techniques and by being introduced to one or more Web-specific scripting languages. As part of this process, students learn how the Web uses these resources as a means of displaying dynamic client-side information. Students learn how to analyze, modify, write and debug algorithms and scripts that use structured programming approaches.
* Recommended prerequisite: [CSE1210: Client-Side Scripting 1](CSE1210.md)

[CSE2910: CSE Project B](CSE2910.md)

* Students develop project design and management skills to extend and enhance competencies and skills in other CTS courses through contexts that are personally relevant.

[CSE2920: CSE Project C](CSE2920.md)

* Students develop project design and management skills to extend and enhance competencies and skills in other CTS courses through contexts that are personally relevant.

[CSE2010: Computer Science 2](CSE2010.md)

* Students explore hardware, software and processes at an intermediate level. Students extend their understanding of software development by learning how to layer modular programming approaches over structured programming techniques to improve the efficiency and robustness of algorithms and programs. They also are introduced to derived data types to provide them with data structures suitable for more demanding problems. Students add to their understanding of the hardware side of computer science by exploring a stylized von Neumann computer system at the machine level, and of the social side of computer science by examining some of the issues that have arisen from the implementation of computer technology.
* Prerequisites: CSE1010: Computer Science 1, CSE1120: Structured Programming 2
