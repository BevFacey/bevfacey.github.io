# COM1165: Printing 1

* Students are introduced to basic layout and design techniques as well as to various print reproduction processes using a positive or negative master such as digital, offset, screen, vinyl plotting, wide format and laser cutting.
* Prerequisite: [COM1005: Visual Composition](COM1005.md)

Talk to your teacher about the devices and projects available, such as posters, t-shirts, mugs, water bottles, and laptop stickers.

## Assignment 1 - Poster Printing

* Find or create some grey-scale artwork that you would like to have as a poster.
* Use this [wall art generator](https://rasterbator.net/) and the lab printer to create a large-format print of your artwork. It should use between 4 and 16 sheets of letter-size paper.
* Take a photo of your completed project.

## Assignment 2 - Hand Cut Vinyl

* Find or create some single-color artwork that you will hand-cut from vinyl sticker or thermal transfer material.
* Ensure that you do not cut through the backing material.
* Remove (weed) the parts that you do not want transferred.
* If sticker material: use masking tape to transfer your sticker to a hard surface
* If thermal transfer: use the heat press to transfer to fabric (e.g. shirt)
* Take a photo of your completed project.

## Assignment 3 - Machine Cut Vinyl

* Find or create some single-color artwork.
* If it is not in vector format, vectorize it using SignLab, Illustrator, Inkscape, or similar program.
* Cut your design using the vinyl cutter.
* Transfer as in the previous assignment.
* Take a photo of your completed project.

## Assignment 4 - CNC

* Use the laser engraver or CNC engraver to create a project (e.g. a keychain) using artwork that you find or create.
* Take a photo of your completed project.

## Assignment 5 - Presentation

* Create a slideshow containing photos of your projects.
* Add a slide for each of the following for each project.
    1. how the elements and principles of design help facilitate good composition
    2. the technical and creative aspects of the work; e.g., quality, uniqueness
    3. areas of concern or difficulty
    4. meeting school and community standards; e.g., appropriate language
    5. the tools and equipment that you used
* Present your work to a peer or an adult
* Submit your slideshow and any feedback you received.

## Competencies and Skills

You will also be evaluated on your basic competencies such as your ability to:

* communicate
* manage information
* use numbers
* think and solve problems
* demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours
* be responsible
* be adaptable
* learn continuously
* work safely
* work with others
* participate in projects and tasks
* make personal connections to the cluster content and processes to inform possible pathway choices
