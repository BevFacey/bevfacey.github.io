# DES1050: CAD 1

* Students develop basic knowledge and skills in computer-aided design (CAD).
* Prerequisite: None

## Assignment 1 - Theory

Answer the following questions:

1. What is the purpose of CAD software?
2. What are some examples of CAD software (both free and paid)?
3. What are some file types associated with computer-aided design?
4. What is the main difference between a plotter and a printer?

## Assignment 2 - CAD Creation

Using CAD software of your choice, create a 2-D scale drawing of an object that is in the room. Make sure you pay attention to:

1. drawing space setup; e.g., toolbar, preferences, units, scale, layers
2. drawing, modify and assist tools; e.g., line types, trim, rotate, offset, inserting blocks
3. [dimensioning and notation](https://www.learnalberta.ca/content/ctmr/MovieResourceLauncher.htm?asset=movies/DES2050AE.mov); e.g., linear and aligned, radius, diameter, circumference, text

## Assignment 3 - Presentation

Present your drawing to a peer or adult and ask for feedback or suggestions.

## Assignment 4 - Job Skills Forms

Complete an [Employability Skills Self-Assessment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeg5oKGSpVoPOOobLzBy20qugNRzDVHIJ4GU4AR6stKZwMFeg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1608836029=DES1040) and a [Personal Inventory Checklist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOEdGul7Omr2ggimeQU-dwUKrWGPU9t52ocposyntKgm7Kjg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1721107223=DES1040).
