1.1.3 fibre optic
1.2 identify and describe the characteristics and uses of common media connectors including:
1.2.1 registered jack 11 (RJ-11)
1.2.2 registered jack 45 (RJ-45)
1.2.3 attachment unit interface (AUI)
1.2.4 British naval connector (BNC)

1.2.6 single mode fibre optic connector; e.g., SC-type, ST-type
1.3 identify Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards for Ethernet cabling including:
1.3.1 bandwidth/speed
1.3.2 transmission mode
1.3.3 maximum segment length
1.3.4 cable type
1.4 identify and describe categories for unshielded twisted pair cable defined by the Electronics Industries Alliance and the Telecommunications Industry Association
1.5 describe the media and function of network backbones and segments
1.6 explain the relationship between media type, connector and topology in a network environment
1.7 choose an appropriate cable type and connector to add a client, given a practical network scenario
2. identify and explain the purpose, features and basic operation of network hardware components
2.1 explain the purpose of hardware components in:
2.1.1 connecting network devices

3.2.1 media testers/certifiers
3.2.2 crossover cable
3.2.3 tone generator and probe; e.g., fox and hound
3.2.4 optical testers
3.3 demonstrate the proper sequence of steps to crimp and test Ethernet cable
3.4 select the appropriate cabling tool and test equipment, given a practical cabling task
4. demonstrate ability to install network cabling, connectors and hardware components
4.1 demonstrate procedures for the compliant installation of:
4.1.1 jacks and outlets
4.1.2 cable and structured cable runs
4.1.3 patch panels and patch cords
4.1.4 network cards
