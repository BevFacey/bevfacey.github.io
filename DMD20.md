* Students develop skills and practical working knowledge of electronic publishing computer hardware and software and create well-designed documents and publications using desktop publishing technology.
* Prerequisite: COM1005: Visual Composition

COM2035: Raster Graphics 1

* A raster format is commonly used in full colour images/graphics and photographs by using a data structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels or points of colour. In this course, students are introduced to the fundamental skills of raster graphics and their application.
* Prerequisite: [COM1035: Graphics Tools](COM1035.md)

COM2045: Vector Graphics 1

* Vector graphics are commonly used in graphic design, page layout, typography, logos, sharp-edged artistic illustrations, technical illustrations, diagramming and flowcharting. In this course, students use vector editing software to create basic vector graphics.
* Prerequisite: COM1035: Graphics Tools

[COM2155: Design â€“ Brand Identity](COM2155.md)

* Students are introduced to the value and importance of branding and the process of creating and establishing strong brands. Students work through the process of creating branding from planning, to the creation of a new, unique brand, through to creating touch points.
* Prerequisite: [COM1035: Graphics Tools](COM1035.md)

COM2165: Printing 2

* Students develop printing skills and create a finished product that demonstrates an ability to reproduce multicolour graphics for use on selected media; e.g., banners, signs, T-shirts, uniforms, posters, ceramics, plastics, decals.
* Prerequisite: COM1165: Printing 1

## Web Design

COM1055: Web Design 1

* Description: Students research the characteristics of effective Web page(s) and learn World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) conventions and accessibility concerns to construct a simple Web page.
* Prerequisite: COM1005: Visual Composition

COM2055: Web Design 2

* Students learn intermediate coding and software applications to produce a Web site.
* Prerequisite: COM1055: Web Design 1

[CSE1210: Client-side Scripting 1](CSE1210.md)

* Students are introduced to Internet computing through the use of one or more Web-specific markup languages. As part of this process, students learn how the Web uses markup languages to provide a client-side approach to display static information. Students also learn how to analyze, modify, write and debug algorithms and documents that use a markup language.
* Prerequisite: None

CSE1220: Client-side Scripting 2

* Students deepen their understanding of Internet computing by using more advanced markup language techniques and by being introduced to one or more Web-specific scripting languages. As part of this process, students learn how the Web uses these resources as a means of displaying dynamic client-side information. Students learn how to analyze, modify, write and debug algorithms and scripts that use structured programming approaches.
* Prerequisite: None

CSE2210: Client-side Scripting 3

* Students add to their understanding of Internet scripting by employing procedural programming techniques and fundamental data structures to create both static and dynamic client-side sites. Students learn how to analyze, modify, write and debug algorithms and scripts that use subprograms such as functions and data structures such as arrays.
* Prerequisites: CSE1220: Client-side Scripting 2, [CSE1120: Structured Programming 2](CSE1120.md)

## 3D and 2D Design and Animation

COM2145: Animation 2

* Students explore the evolution of various animation styles and techniques (traditional and digital). Students apply planning, idea development and storytelling techniques to create an effective animation.
* Prerequisite: COM1145: Animation 1

COM2175: Interactive Presentation

* Students refine presentation skills and develop and author interactive multimedia presentations using advanced presentation software tools and techniques.
* Prerequisite: COM1005: Visual Composition

DES2035: 2-D Design 2

* Students continue to develop skills and techniques for 2-D design by using tools, materials and processes common to 2-D design to complete a variety of project activities.
* Prerequisite: DES1030: 2-D Design 1

DES2045: 3-D Design 2

* Students continue to develop skills and techniques for 3-D design by using tools, materials and processes common to 3-D design to complete a variety of project activities.
* Prerequisite: DES1040: 3-D Design 1

DES2060: Evolution of Design

Description: Students develop a historical framework and study the importance and relevance of design within a cultural context by examining past and contemporary examples of designed artifacts.
Prerequisite: None
