[ELT2160: Robotics Sensor 1](ELT2160.md)

* Students demonstrate how basic sensors are used in a robotic system.
* Prerequisite: ELT1140: Robotics Applications

[CSE1120:  Structured Programming 2](CSE1120.md)

* Students work with structured programming constructs by adding the selection and iteration program control flow mechanisms to their programming repertoire. They write structured algorithms and programs that use blocks to introduce an element of modularity into their programming practice.
* Prerequisite: CSE1110: Structured Programming 1

[CSE2240: Robotics Programming 2](CSE2240.md)

* Students add to their understanding of robotics programming by employing procedural programming techniques and fundamental data structures to create programs that display greater agency and autonomy. They learn how to analyze, modify, write and debug robotics algorithms and programs in which modularity is achieved through subprograms such as functions and fundamental data structures such as arrays.
* Prerequisites: CSE1240: Robotics Programming 1, CSE1120: Structured Programming 2

[ELT3910: ELT Project D](ELT3910.md)

* Students develop project design and management skills to extend and enhance competencies and skills in other CTS courses through contexts that are personally relevant.

[ELT3920: ELT Project E](ELT3920.md)

* Students develop project design and management skills to extend and enhance competencies and skills in other CTS courses through contexts that are personally relevant.

CSE3240: Robotics Programming 3

ELT2170: Robotics Sensor 2

[ELT3170: Robotics Microprocessors](ELT3170.md)

* Students compare central processing unit (CPU) architecture of programmable robotics engineered systems and interface with analog sensors.
* Prerequisites: [ELT1140: Robotics Applications](ELT1140.md), [CSE3120: Object Oriented Programming 1](CSE3120.md)

ELT3150: Robotics 3

[ELT3180: Robotics Vision Systems](ELT3180.md)
