# ELT1010: Electro-assembly 1

Students apply basic fabricating and servicing techniques to construct and test electronic and electromagnetic devices and cables.

## Circuit 1

### Construct a Simple Circuit

1. Go to [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com)
  * **Log In** (click **Personal accounts** and use your school Google account)
  * click the **Create** button and choose **Circuits**
2. Create a virtual circuit for turning on and off an LED. Use the following components:
  * 1 LED
  * 1 220 Ω resistor
  * 1 pushbutton
  * 2 AA batteries
3. Recreate a similar circuit, but replace the pushbutton with a slideswitch and the LED with an RGB LED.

### Construct and Analyze a Control Circuit:

1. Using TinkerCAD circuits, construct and program a virtual traffic light with the following components:
  * 3 LEDs
  * 1 220 Ω resistor
  * 1 micro:bit
  * 1 [breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)
2. Describe what happens in each of these cases:
  * the resistor is replaced with just a wire
  * a wire directly connects one of the micro:bit outputs to the ground (GND)
  * an LED is reversed (the long lead is connected to ground side)
  * the resistor is reversed
3. In your TinkerCAD circuit, add the three multimeters to measure:
  * the voltage between pin0 and GND
  * the amperage through the green LED
  * the resistance across the resistor
4. Read [Sparkfun how to use a multimeter](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/all).
5. Measure the voltage of a physical battery, and compare it to the labelled voltage.
6. Choose two different physical resistors and measure their resistance with one of our multimeters. How does your reading compare to the [color bands](https://www.digikey.ca/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code)?
7. Recreate your working circuit using real parts.
8. Take a screenshot of your virtual circuit and a video of your physical circuit, and include them with your submission.

## Safety

You have just been appointed Health and Safety Offier for our Robotics Lab. Your first task is to begin creating a **Lab Safety Manual** based on [Alberta Occupational Heath and Safety](https://www.alberta.ca/occupational-health-safety) to train new employees. Include the following sections:

### Section 1 - The Safety System

Every safe workplace relies on a system, not just luck. Research the 8 Elements of a Health and Safety System. In your document, create a summary table or infographic that answers these simple questions for each element:

1. Management & Leadership: Who is responsible for safety here, and how do they show they care? (e.g. who sets the rules).
2. Hazard Identification: How do we find dangers before they hurt someone?
3. Hazard Control: Once we find a danger, what do we do about it?
4. Competency & Training: How do we prove we are skilled enough to use the tools?
5. Work Site Inspection: How often do we check the lab, and what are we looking for?
6. Incident Investigation: If an accident happens, what steps do we take to find out why?
7. Emergency Response: What is the plan for a fire, chemical spill (flux), or severe injury?
8. Administration: How do we keep records (e.g., attendance, safety quiz results) to prove our system works?

### Section 2 - Hazard Idenfication, Assessment, and Control

1. Describe the three steps of the **Hazard Assessment** process (identify, assess, control).
2. Explain the [Hierarchy of Controls](https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/hsprograms/hazard/hierarchy_controls.html) for a process such as soldering.

### Section 3 - Robotics Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

Create **Safe Work Guidelines** for the following tasks:

1. Electrical Safety and Protection
  * The Hazards: What happens if you touch a live wire? What is a short circuit?
  * The Protection: Find an image of a Fuse or Circuit Breaker. Explain in 2 sentences how this protects both the robot and the human.
  * The Rules: List 3 things to **never do** when working with powered circuits.
2. Soldering Station Training
  * The Gear: Identify the Soldering Iron, Solder, and Flux. Explain the safety risk associated with each.
  * The Setup: Include a picture of a safe soldering workspace.
  * The Procedure: Write a 6-step checklist for soldering a connection safely, starting with ventilation and finishing with washing hands.
3. Hand Tools
  * Identify other tools used in the soldering process.
  * Write a guide for passing sharp tools to another student.

### Section 4 - Safety Pledge

Write a brief **Code of Conduct** for yourself.

* How will you demonstrate a positive attitude toward safety?
* How will you look out for your teammates?
* Sign and date the statement, promising to follow these rules.

## Soldering

1. Read and follow the [Adafruit soldering tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering).
2. Solder ends on a TRS (tip ring sleeve) headphone cable using [this tutorial](https://smallusefultips.com/how-do-i-solder-trs-cable).
3. Use a multimeter to continuity test your new cable.
4. Submit photos of your completed cable.

## Theory

On a piece of paper:

1. Define each of the following, including hand-drawn diagrams:
  * voltage
  * polarity
  * current
  * resistance
2. Draw each of the following connectors:
  * 3-pin power
  * TRS audio
  * network cable (RJ45)
  * VGA connector
3. Write about how AC is different from DC, and which we use for our circuits in robotics.
4. Choose two of the following devices and briefly explain, in your own words, how they work:
  * [speakers](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/speaker.htm)
  * [microphones](https://mynewmicrophone.com/how-do-microphones-work-a-helpful-illustrated-guide)
  * [DC motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_motor)
  * [mechanical relays](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/howrelayswork.html)
  * [Maglev trains](https://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/maglev-train.htm)
  * [magnetic hard drives](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/hard-disk.htm)
  * [doorbells](https://www.wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-does-a-doorbell-work)
  * [lifting electromagnets](https://science.howstuffworks.com/electromagnet.htm)
5. Describe the differences (purposes and functions) between [fuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_(electrical)), [circuit breakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker), and [GFCI outlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual-current_device).
6. What is a [relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay)? Why would an engineer choose a relay instead of directly powering a device from a microcontroller pin?
7. Identify a career that uses soldering and circuit testing.
