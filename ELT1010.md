# ELT1010: Electro-assembly 1

Students apply basic fabricating and servicing techniques to construct and test electronic and electromagnetic devices and cables.

## Safety

In a document, slide deck, video, or other (approved) medium:
1. Create a health and safety plan with special emphasis on conditions and factors related to robotics. Research and identify the following eight common elements of a health and safety management system:
  * management, leadership and organizational commitment including policies, guidelines and responsibilities
  * hazard identification and assessment
  * hazard control
  * worker competency and training including: technical competence, safe work practices and procedures, personal protective equipment
  * work site inspection
  * incident investigation
  * emergency response
  * management system administration including: evaluation, records and statistics, maintenance of system
1. Research common processes and methods of hazard identification, assessment and control:
  * research and identify common job site hazard identification processes
  * research and identify common methods for assessment and control of hazards
  * explain and demonstrate appropriate health and safety effective practices
1. Describe (and demonstrate) safe practices when working with:
  * electrical circuits (including electrical protection devices)
  * solder and flux
  * 

## Circuits

1. Construct and analyze a simple control circuit:
  * Using TinkerCAD circuits, construct a virtual traffic light simulator, including three LEDs and a micro:bit.
  * Recreate your working circuit using real LEDs, micro:bit, and a [breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all).
1. TODO: soldering
1. TODO: measuring voltage and continuity (multimeter, alarm)

## Theory

In a document, slide deck, video, or other (approved) medium:
1. Write about how you created your virtual traffic light versus how you created it with real parts.
1. Define voltage, polarity, current, and resistance.
1. Write about how AC is different from DC, and which we use for our circuits in robotics.
1. Choose three of the following devices and briefly explain, in your own words, how they work:
  * [speakers](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/speaker.htm)
  * [microphones](https://mynewmicrophone.com/how-do-microphones-work-a-helpful-illustrated-guide)
  * [DC motors](https://ie.rs-online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=ideas-and-advice/dc-motors-guide)
  * [mechanical relays](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/howrelayswork.html)
  * [Maglev trains](https://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/maglev-train.htm)
  * [magnetic hard drives](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/hard-disk.htm)
  * [doorbells](https://www.wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-does-a-doorbell-work)
  * [lifting electromagnets](https://science.howstuffworks.com/electromagnet.htm)
1. Describe the differences (purposes and functions) between [fuses](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zshyj6f/revision/3), [circuit breakers](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/circuit-breaker.htm), and [GFCI outlets](https://homeinspectioninsider.com/gfci-outlet).
1. Using images and words, identify common electrical/electronic cables and connectors used in power, audio and video connections, including network cables, computer cables, and audio and video cables.
1. Complete/update a personal inventory; e.g., interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning and experiences. Include how this would relate to possible future jobs.
