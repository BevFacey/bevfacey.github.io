# ELT1010: Electro-assembly 1

Students apply basic fabricating and servicing techniques to construct and test electronic and electromagnetic devices and cables.

## Theory

1. create a health and safety plan with special emphasis on conditions and factors related to the specific pathway or series of courses:
  * research and identify the following eight common elements of a health and safety management system:
    * management, leadership and organizational commitment including policies, guidelines and responsibilities
    * hazard identification and assessment
    * hazard control
    * worker competency and training including: technical competence, safe work practices and procedures, personal protective equipment
    * work site inspection
    * incident investigation
    * emergency response
    * management system administration including: evaluation, records and statistics, maintenance of system
1.2 explain each of the elements reflecting on occupational health and safety implications
1.3 define health and safety elements relevant to the world-of-work
1.4 present a health and safety plan clarifying its relevance to the work world and society in general
2. research common processes and methods of hazard identification, assessment and control specific to the pathway or series of courses
2.1 research and identify common job site hazard identification processes
2.2 research and identify common methods for assessment and control of hazards
2.3 explain and demonstrate appropriate health and safety effective practices
2.4 demonstrate a proactive personal commitment toward improvement of workplace health and safety including concern for others and following instructions, rules and guidelines
3. apply the appropriate fabrication techniques, including proper soldering and component assembly procedures, to construct and test a simple electronic circuit
3.1 construct and analyze a simple control circuit
3.2 use various breadboarding techniques to be able to understand methods used; e.g., nail and board sector and spring clip, wire wrap, point-to-point and solderless breadboard 3.3 identify components
3.4 measure voltage and continuity to appraise condition of circuit using appropriate instrumentation; e.g., simple alarm, simple automobile circuit, multimeter (digital and analog)
4. apply the appropriate fabrication techniques to construct and test an electromagnetic device
4.1 define AC/DC voltage and polarity
4.2 use proper solder and soldering techniques to gain an understanding of their value
4.3 analyze several magnetic devices to formulate an understanding of their function; e.g., speakers, electromagnetic crane, tape heads, moving magnetic pick-ups, relays, magnetic strip, levitation trains, magnetic device in hard drive
5. identify and assemble common electrical/electronic cables and connectors used in power, audio and video connections
5.1 install specialty connectors and cables to acquire knowledge and skills
5.2 demonstrate an understanding of specialty cables that link systems with special functions including fibre optics, coaxial and telephone
6. demonstrate established laboratory procedures and safe work practices
6.1 demonstrate safe home/laboratory procedures with respect to electrical hazards and use of solder and flux
6.2 identify and explain the importance of electrical protection devices
7. demonstrate basic competencies
7.1 demonstrate fundamental skills to: 7.1.1 communicate
7.1.2 manage information
7.1.3 use numbers
7.1.4 think and solve problems
7.2 demonstrate personal management skills to:
7.2.1 demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours 7.2.2 be responsible
7.2.3 be adaptable
7.2.4 learn continuously
7.2.5 work safely
7.3 demonstrate teamwork skills to:
7.3.1 work with others
7.3.2 participate in projects and tasks
8. make personal connections to the cluster content and processes to inform possible pathway choices
8.1 complete/update a personal inventory; e.g., interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning and experiences
8.2 create a connection between a personal inventory and occupational choices
