# Computing Science 10

[CSE1010: Computer Science 1](CSE1010.md)
* Students explore hardware, software and processes. This includes an introduction to the algorithm as a problem-solving tool, to programming languages in general and to the role of programming as a tool for implementing algorithms.

[CSE1110: Structured Programming 1](CSE1110.md)
* Students are introduced to a general programming environment in which they write simple structured algorithms and programs that input, process and output data, use some of the more basic operators and data types, and follow a sequential flow of control.

CSE1120: Structured Programming 2
* Students work with structured programming constructs by adding the selection and iteration program control flow mechanisms to their programming repertoire. They write structured algorithms and programs that use blocks to introduce an element of modularity into their programming practice.
* Prerequisite: CSE1110: Structured Programming 1

CSE1210: Client-side Scripting 1
* Students are introduced to Internet computing through the use of one or more Web-specific markup languages. As part of this process, students learn how the Web uses markup languages to provide a client-side approach to display static information. Students also learn how to analyze, modify, write and debug algorithms and documents that use a markup language.

CSE2110: Procedural Programming 1
* Students develop their understanding of the procedural programming paradigm. They move from a structured programming approach in which modules were handled through the use of program blocks to a more formal modular programming approach in which they are handled through subprograms. In the process, students also learn to use a number of new design approaches made possible by the new paradigms. As part of this process, they also learn what types of problems are amenable to modular algorithms and programs.
* Prerequisite: CSE1120: Structured Programming 2

CSE1910: CSE Project A
* Students develop project design and management skills to extend and enhance competencies and skills in other CTS courses through contexts that are personally relevant.
