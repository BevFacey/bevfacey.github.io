# COM2045: Vector Graphics 1

* Vector graphics are commonly used in graphic design, page layout, typography, logos, sharp-edged artistic illustrations, technical illustrations, diagramming and flowcharting. In this course, students use vector editing software to create basic vector graphics.
* Prerequisite: [COM1035: Graphics Tools](COM1035.md)

## Assignment 1 - Create and Edit Vector Images

Create vector images using graphic applications such as Illustrator, Photoshop, or Inkscape.

1. set up a document, considering;
    1. printed area; e.g., single or multipage documents, artboards
    2. document profile; e.g., print, Web, mobile devices, video and film, basic cyan-magenta-yellow-key black (CMYK) colour model, basic red-green-blue (RGB) colour model
    3. colour spaces
2. draw and transform objects by:
    1. creating and modifying a vector object using a pen tool and bezier controls
    2. adjusting stroke settings
    3. cutting, erasing or deleting portions of an object by using the appropriate tool(s)
    4. editing objects, groups, symbols and more layers
    5. creating a mask to hide parts of objects
    6. using open and closed paths, compound paths and compound shapes
    7. selecting one or more objects and arranging their stacking order
    8. modifying an object with one or more transformation tools
3. manage colour and transparency by:
    1. setting up colour management settings and proof colour onscreen
    2. creating or loading colour swatches
    3. applying transparency options to objects
4. use type by:
    1. creating text objects
    2. formatting time by using character and paragraph attributes
    3. creating and applying character and paragraph styles to text
    4. using special characters
5. control effects, appearance and styles by:
    1. adjusting the appearance of objects
    2. saving and applying graphic styles
6. build objects by:
    1. creating and formatting a graph
    2. using and control gradient match
    3. using and adjusting the settings for blend tool
    4. choosing and/or creating the appropriate brush
7. import images into the document
8. prepare for electronic output by:
    1. creating output for the Web and/or mobile devices using proper settings
    2. choosing the correct over-printing options
    3. previewing and analyzing colour separations
9. prepare for print output

## Assignment 2 - Presentation

1. Present a selection of work completed in this course to an audience.
2. Based on feedback and reflection, give yoursef a rating on a scale of 1 to 4 for each of the following:
    1. how the elements and principles of design help facilitate good composition
    2. the technical and creative aspects of the work; e.g., quality, uniqueness
    3. areas of concern/difficulty (if applicable)
    4. meeting school and community standards; e.g., appropriate language
    5. the use of tools and equipment

## Competencies and Skills

You will also be evaluated on your basic competencies such as your ability to:

* communicate
* manage information
* use numbers
* think and solve problems
* demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours
* be responsible
* be adaptable
* learn continuously
* work safely
* work with others
* participate in projects and tasks
* recognize and then analyze the opportunities and barriers in the immediate environment
* identify potential resources to minimize barriers and maximize opportunities
