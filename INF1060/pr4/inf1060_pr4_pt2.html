  <h3>Project 4: Final Project</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Part 2: Personal Expenses</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Armed with your debit card  and a simulated bank account balance, you are to come up with realistic  expenses that you might have over the course of three months. How good are you  with your money?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your job is  to keep personal records of expenses for a period of three months. On the last day of each month, a personal  allowance of $500 is deposited into your bank account. For this exercise, you  have no other income.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your bank balance  on January 1 is $2509.58. You will use your debit card for every transaction. You  are not allowed to spend more money than you have in your account at any time. At  the end of the third month (March), you must have entered a minimum of 30  transactions. (Try to enter at least 10 transactions for every month.)</p>

  <p>Open the <a href="inf1060_pr4_pt2.xlsx" target="_blank">Personal  Expenses</a> spreadsheet, and follow the  instructions provided.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Instructions</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Replace “Your Name” with your actual  name.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Format the dates to the current year.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Examine the column headings. Change  the headings to suit you or insert more columns for additional expenses.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Merge, center, and format titles.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Format the cells accordingly (date,  currency, etc.).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Use formulas to calculate the total expenses. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Use a formula in the column Bank  Balance that will subtract the total expenses from the previous balance and add  the income. Copy the formula down at least 30 cells.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 8: </strong>Create at least 30 realistic  transactions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 9: </strong>Incorporate a monthly bank service  charge of $5.00. These will occur on the last day of each month.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 10: </strong>On March 31, enter “Total” in the Description  cell.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 11: </strong>Total each expense column and the  Income column.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 12: </strong>Format the table appropriately. You  may want to use one of the built-in formats.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 13: </strong>Create a pie chart that depicts your  total expenses. Place it below your data. Format your chart appropriately,  giving it a legend; explode your highest expense.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step  14: </strong>Save your spreadsheet in your INF1060 SS1 folder  in the appropriate place.</p>
