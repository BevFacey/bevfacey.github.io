  <p>But  wait! The surprised look on your face turns serious when you learn there’s a  catch! You are informed that the total cost of all the items you select must  not exceed (go over) $1000.00, GST included. Also, the total cost of all the  items (GST included) must fall between $995.00 and $1000.00 or you lose  everything.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a problem!&rdquo; you exclaim. &ldquo;I have a secret weapon called a  spreadsheet! I can make it do the math for me, right down to the very last  penny! Show me the money!&rdquo; <br />

  <p>Use  the Internet to find the items you want. Shop places like Best Buy, Walmart,  Costco, West 49, etc. When you are ready to start, open the <a href="inf1060_pr4_pt1.xlsx" target="_blank">Most Wanted</a> spreadsheet and follow the  instructions provided to format the spreadsheet correctly. You can keep your  spreadsheet open on the screen and your browser loaded with the websites you  are using. This will allow you to work more efficiently if you need to switch  back and forth between the two programs to check new prices online or to delete  items that cost too much from your spreadsheet.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Continue  spending your $1,000.00 on your Most Wanted items. Don’t forget that the total  cost of all the items (tax included) must fall between $995.00 and $1000.00 or  you lose <strong>all</strong> the money.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Save your Most Wanted spreadsheet in your INF1060 SS1  folder.</p>
