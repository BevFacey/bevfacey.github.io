  <p>In today's digital world, technology is everywhere. It is used at  schools, in homes, and in the workplace. Having a variety of technological  skills is an essential part of your skill set. Knowing how spreadsheets work  and how to use them is becoming a basic skill that will help you in your personal  life, at school, and as you enter the work world. Personally, you should have a sense of money  management and budgeting; for school, you need to be able to solve mathematical  problems and organize information; and in the workplace, you may need to  perform “what if” analyses to make the business more efficient and/or  profitable and present your findings to others in the company. It is essential  that you have these basic spreadsheet skills.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What is required to complete this project?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To complete this project, you will need the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>access to a  computer with spreadsheet software<br />
      (Note: All examples for this module are  based on Microsoft® Office Excel® 2007.)<br />
  </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>a place to save  your work, such as the INF1060 SS1 folder created earlier<br />
      (Note: Discuss this arrangement with  your teacher—e.g., network, folder, flash drive, personal desktop.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What do I already know?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You may  already be familiar with spreadsheets from other courses you have taken. Can you  remember a time where you had to create a simple spreadsheet to solve a math  problem? You may also have entered data into a table using spreadsheet  software. If you haven't seen a spreadsheet before, don't worry. This course will  take you right from opening Microsoft® Excel® 2007 for the very first time  through to using formulas and creating charts.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
