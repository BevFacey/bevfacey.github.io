  <p>You may have already worked with spreadsheets at school. Have you seen  the  Microsoft® Excel® 2007 software? This training room is an introduction  to Microsoft® Excel® 2007.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you are new to spreadsheets  or have never used version 2007 before, carefully work through this training  room.

You can access training, demonstrations, webcasts, podcasts, and  information on how to become Microsoft Office Certified. Microsoft Online can  be a place where you go to refresh your memory or to learn a new skill.</p>
