  <p>When it comes time to make your presentation, you will need to be able to  print your worksheets. You need to ensure that all your information fits on one  page or that the page breaks make sense, ensure that that there is a title (or  header) on the pages, as well as make other adjustments as necessary. One way  to be environmentally friendly is to avoid wasting paper. To do this, you need  to be aware of how to preview your documents before you print. Not only will  you print exactly what you want the first time, but you will also save time and  energy by not waiting for print jobs to finish.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>preview before  you print</li>
    <li>set print options  (portrait or landscape, etc.)</li>

    <li>format headers  and footers</li>
    <li>modify the worksheet  (gridlines, page order, print area, etc.)</li>
    <li>print</li>
  </ul>
