  <p>The ability to compare data and evaluate changes in data is easily done  using charts. Charts are visual representations of data. They can quickly show  the reader, for example, cost comparisons of various items, the performance of  each salesperson at a dealership, or the amount of inventory in each department  of an organization. In presentations, charts are very powerful tools when  reporting data to a group of people or to an organization. It is important to  know how to develop charts to accurately represent the data you wish to  showcase. </p>
