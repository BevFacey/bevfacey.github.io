  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Complete the following steps in order. You will  create charts on two separate worksheets: the Pie Chart worksheet and the  Columnar Chart worksheet.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Open <a href="inf1060_pr3_trr8_ttp.xlsx" target="_blank">Time to Practise 8</a>.</p>

  <p>On the Pie Chart worksheet,  complete these steps:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Title the pie chart “Expenses.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Portray the data labels as percents. Go into  Quick Layout to change their format in the Design tab.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Resize the chart appropriately, and place it below  the table.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Explode the pie piece that depicts Advertising  expense.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Format the background appropriately.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On the Columnar Chart  worksheet, complete these steps:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 8: </strong>Create a columnar chart for What a Wonderful World  Travel that highlights Brockhoff’s information.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 9: </strong>Title the columnar chart “Brockhoff’s  Expenses.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 10: </strong>Remove the legend.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 11: </strong>Format the labels for Auto Rental, Air Fare,  etc., to 10-point Arial bold.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 12: </strong>If needed, resize the chart so the labels are  easy to read.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 13: </strong>Format the bars to make them red with a  shadow. Use the Quick Layout in the Design tab to do this.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 14: </strong>Turn off the gridlines.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 15: </strong>Format the background of the whole chart so  that the axes are easy to read.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 16: </strong>Save the document as Time to Practise 8 in  your INF1060 SS1 folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
