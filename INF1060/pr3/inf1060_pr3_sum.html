  <h3>Project 3: Spreadsheet Skills</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Project 3 Summary</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now that you have completed all eight training rooms and Time to Practise exercises, you have developed technological skills that you will stay with you forever. You can now use spreadsheet software to perform calculations and organize data. You have developed skills that can be used in all aspects of your life. Can you see the connections between these skills and their use in your personal life, in other school subjects (including post secondary), as well as the workforce? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You should be confident with your newly acquired skills and ready to move on to your final project.  Good luck!</p>
