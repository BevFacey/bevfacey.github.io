  <p> Most of the work involved in this course occurs  in this project, which includes working through eight training rooms and completing  eight Time to Practise exercises.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Each of the eight training rooms should take approximately 2 hours to  complete. Depending on your skill and experience, you may work through some  training rooms faster than others. Efficiently working through the training  rooms will ensure that you have enough time to complete this entire course.</p>
  <p>                                              </p>
  <h5>Checking Your Work </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once you  have completed the training rooms, complete the Time to Practise exercises that  accompany them. The Time to Practise exercises are provided for you to practise  the skills covered in the training room. Make sure you contact your teacher if  you have questions about this process or need help completing any of the work.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Use the <a href="../inf1060_skilllscheck.doc" target="_blank">INF1060:  Spreadsheet 1 Software Skills Checklist</a> to evaluate your level of understanding. Check off the  skills you are able to demonstrate as you progress through the training rooms. You  must be competent in all software skills presented in the training rooms before  beginning the final projects. Print or save a copy of the software checklist  now. The checklist can also be found in the Toolkit.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can  repeat training rooms and demonstrations as necessary if you encounter difficulties  with the software or with the Time to Practise exercises. You can also refer to  Microsoft® Help and Online references for software training and demonstrations.  If you experience any road blocks, contact your teacher for help and support.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Extending Beyond</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>INF1060:  Spreadsheet 1 is one of many courses related to the business world. You may be  interested in completing INF2080: Spreadsheet 2 next, as these two courses will  set you well on your way to possible Microsoft Certification.</p>
