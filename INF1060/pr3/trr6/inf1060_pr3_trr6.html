  <p>Using a spreadsheet to organize and display your data is useful. Using  a spreadsheet to perform mathematical operations is essential to companies to  set budgets, calculate profit margins, keep inventories, and so on. Personally,  you can use a spreadsheet to keep track of your own expenses, calculate  interest on purchases, or create a timesheet for work. Microsoft® Excel® has  the ability to make these calculations easily and will update your calculated  values as you change your data.</p>
