  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Instructions</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this exercise you will  apply all of the knowledge and skills covered in Training Room 6. Read through  the following instructions to see what you need to do to complete Time to  Practise 6.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Complete the following  steps in order.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Open <a href="inf1060_pr3_trr6_ttp.xlsx" target="_blank">Time to Practise 6</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Read the problem at the top of the worksheet.  Before you begin solving the problem, estimate the amount you think Jean will  make after 28 days. Enter your estimate in cell C6. Make sure this cell is  formatted for currency.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Starting in cell A13, use the fill handle to  enter the remaining days of February in column A.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In cell B10, enter a formula that calculates the  product of cell B9 multiplied by 2.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Starting in cell B10, use the fill handle to  copy the formula down the column to February 28. Resize the column widths if  needed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>In cell F6, use a formula to calculate the  total amount Jean will earn in February. Again, make sure that this cell is  formatted for currency.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 7: </strong>Answer the three questions on the worksheet.  Place your answers in the yellow cells provided. Use formulas where you can.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 8: </strong>Create a header with your name and the date.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 9: </strong>Save the document as Time to Practise 6 in  your INF1060 SS1 folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 10: </strong>Open your Software  Skills Checklist and complete the chart for the skills you developed in this  training room.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If needed, revisit  Training Room 6 to review any of the skills in which you had difficulties. If  you are confident in your skills and abilities, then move on to Training Room 7.</p>
