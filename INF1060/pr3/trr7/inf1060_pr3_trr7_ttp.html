  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Instructions</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this exercise you will  apply all of the knowledge and skills covered in Training Room 7. Read through  the following instructions to see what you need to do to complete Time to  Practise 7.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Complete the following steps in order.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Open <a href="inf1060_pr3_trr7_ttp.xlsx" target="_blank">Time to Practise 7</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In cell F4 of the Time to Practise 7a  worksheet, calculate Carina’s total income for the four months. Use the most  efficient formula you can; then use the fill handle to calculate the total  income of the other three people. Format the cells for currency if needed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In cell B9 calculate the total income of the  four people in January. Use the Subtotal function in your formula, and ensure  cell B7 is included in your formula. Then calculate the total income for the  other three months. Format the cells for currency if needed.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In cell G2 insert 30% as the income tax  rate. Then in column G calculate the income tax amount for each person using an  absolute cell reference in your formula. Insert a new column heading called  “Income Tax” to match the rest of the table.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Set up the Time to Practise 7a worksheet to  display the formulas.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Open the Time to Practise 7b worksheet, and  complete the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sort  by city from A to Z.</li>
    <li>Filter  out all Calgary locations.</li>
    <li>Filter  out all entries with an income of less than or equal to $22,000.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Save the document as Time to Practise 7 in  your INF1060 SS1 folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Open your Software  Skills Checklist and complete the chart for the skills you developed in this  training room.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If needed, revisit  Training Room 7 to review any of the skills in which you had difficulties. If  you are confident in your skills and abilities, then move on to Training Room 8.</p>
