  <p>You can use  electronic spreadsheets to organize, manipulate, and analyze several types of  data. Spreadsheets work best with numerical data—numbers, dates, and times—because  they can perform most kinds of calculations very quickly. With a spreadsheet,  you can create tables of numbers and continually change data to perform &quot;what  if&quot; analyses. No matter how you decide to use spreadsheets, you can  present the information in visually attractive chart formats to support your  conclusions. The nice part of using a spreadsheet is that if you change or  update your data, your results as determined by formulas will also update.<br />
