  <h3>Orientation</h3>

  <p>This is an introductory level course that will introduce you to  spreadsheets and teach you how to use them to manipulate information, perform  calculations, and create graphs to present your information. You will discover  how to establish proper routines and practices that promote safety and security,  and you will practise basic competencies or employability skills as you work  through the course. You will also examine your personal inventory (or interests  and values) and make connections to possible career pathways.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This course is designed using Microsoft® Excel® 2007 on a PC and will  provide instructions for this software application. If you are using previous  versions of Excel® or a program other than Excel® 2007, use the Help menu within the software you are using to find the similar function or feature. You can also search the Internet for help. Microsoft  Office Online is a rich source of training presentations, demos, podcasts, and webcasts that  teaches you how to use the software features. Remember, your teacher is also there  to guide you in the right direction. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Included in  this course are eight training rooms. They provide instruction and allow you to  practise the skills needed to successfully complete the course. You are also  required to complete a Time to Practise exercise after each of the eight training  rooms. These practice exercises allow you to demonstrate the application of the  skills learned.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At the end of  this course you will be ready to complete your final project, which will assess  your skills in creating spreadsheets and presenting information. Once you  successfully complete the final project and your skills assessments, you will  earn one credit towards your high school diploma. A professional portfolio of  your work is a valuable tool that can be used for job interviews to demonstrate  your spreadsheet skills. Discuss creating a portfolio with your teacher. For  now, save everything in a folder on your computer.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Real-world Connections</h5>

Soft skills are what make you a  good employee: having a positive attitude and being a creative problem solver, good team member, and skilled communicator.
