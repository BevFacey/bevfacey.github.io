# NET3050: Network Operating Systems

Students examine the features, advantages and disadvantages of major network operating systems and the criteria involved in selecting network operating  systems that are appropriate in specific networking environments. They develop the knowledge and skills required to install and configure different network and  client operating systems and develop a strategy for troubleshooting problems resulting from the installation of operating system software. 

* Prerequisites: 
[NET2030: Network Structures](NET2030.md), [NET2040: Network Media & Devices](NET2040.md), [NET2050: Open System Interconnection](NET2050.md), [NET2060: Network Protocols](MET2060.md), [NET2070: Local Area Networks](NET2070.md)
