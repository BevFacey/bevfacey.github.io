B. Write a paragraph (or create a recording) to discuss the use of the elements and principles of design in purposeful text creation; e.g., attention-getting text versus readable text.

C. For each of the following, decide which of the two fonts is more approprate and explain why.

    1. a business letter (Cambria or Lucida Blackletter)

### Assignment 4 - Demonstration Compositions Projects

A. Create **two** visual composition projects using a variety of media (e.g., print, photography, video, animation) where a number of elements and principles of design are used. Examples of projects include [typographical images](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=h_&q=typographical+image&iax=images&ia=images), [kinetic typography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_typography), [word art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_art), [tag clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud), or advertisements.

B. Present the completed compositions to other students and/or some adults and then give yourself a rating out of four on each of the following for each composition. You may also add comments to each rating.

    1. The elements and principles of design helped facilitate good composition in my composition.
    2. My composition is unique.
    3. My composition is of good quality.
    4. My composition demonstrates good technical skills.
    5. The purpose or theme of the composition is clear.
    6. The composition is appropriate for school and community standards.
    7. I received meaning feedback from the people I presented to.
    8. I was able to overcome difficulties and address concerns with my work.
    9. Through this project I grew in my knowledge and skills.

C. Provide feedback for at least one other student on their compositions.

    1. Identify elements and principles used in the compositions.
    2. Comment on the impact of the elements and principles in the construction of the message.
    3. Provide feedback on the technical aspects and overall quality of the compositions.
