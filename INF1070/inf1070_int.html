  <h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Welcome to INF1070: Digital Presentation! </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>INF1070: Digital Presentation is an introductory-level presentation  software course that will teach you how to create and format a presentation;  add graphics, charts, and tables; and collaborate to deliver a professional  presentation. You will discover how to establish proper routines and practices  that promote safety and security, and you will practise basic competencies or  employability skills as you work through the course. You will also examine your  personal inventory (or interests and values) and make connections to possible  career pathways.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This course is designed using Microsoft PowerPoint&reg; 2007 on a PC and will provide instructions for this software application. If  you are using previous versions of PowerPoint, use the Help menu and the  keyword search feature for software instruction and discuss with your teacher  how to modify the exercises as necessary. You can also search the Internet for  help. Microsoft Office Online is a rich source of training that provides demonstrations, podcasts,  and webcasts that teach you how to use the software features. Remember, your  teacher is also there to guide you in the right direction. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Included in  this course are five training rooms. They provide instruction and allow you to  practise the skills needed to successfully complete the course. You are also required  to complete a Time to Practice exercise after each of the five training rooms.  These practice exercises are an opportunity for you to practise and demonstrate  the skills learned in the training room. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>At the end of  this course you will be ready to complete your final project, which will assess  your skills in preparing a digital presentation. Once you successfully complete  the final project and your skills assessments, you will earn one credit towards  your high school diploma. A professional portfolio of your work is a valuable  tool that can be used for job interviews to demonstrate your presentation  skills. Discuss creating a portfolio with your teacher. For now, save  everything in a folder on your computer.</p>

  <h5>Real-world Connections </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To be successful  in the work world, you need to have hard and soft skills. Hard skills are  technical skills related to your job that make you productive and efficient—like  knowing how to create a proper letter. Soft skills are the basic competencies  you will practise throughout this module. Soft skills are what make you a good  employee: having a positive attitude and being a creative problem solver, a good  team member, and a skilled communicator. Whether you are interested in a career  in business, technology, health sciences, or trades, all industries are increasingly  in need of employees with strong computer skills.<br />
