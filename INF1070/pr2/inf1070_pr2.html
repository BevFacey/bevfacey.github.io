  <p>Imagine yourself as the boss or the owner of a  company. What basic skills would you look for in your employees? What are the characteristics  of a valuable employee? Workplace skills  and attributes are called <em>Basic Competencies</em> in Career and Technology Studies.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Practising and refining your basic competency  skills on a daily basis will help you be more productive and successful in  every task you undertake—whether at school, at work, or in your personal life.  Basic competencies are the <strong>soft skills</strong> employers value in their employees, what  group members value in their peers, and skills that give you a sense of pride  and satisfaction in your work.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="left2blockColour">
    <p><strong>soft skill:</strong> a person’s personality,  social refinement, language skills, or personal and/or work habits that  contribute to efficient and successful productivity</p>
  </div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this project you will examine the basic  competencies and how they relate to your success in this course.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What is required to  complete this project?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To complete this project, you will need the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic  Competencies Rubric </li>
    <li>a friend or  family member to converse with </li>
    <li>materials (digital  or non-digital) to create a brief presentation</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What do I already know?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>All people, to some degree, have basic competency  skills. Existing skills can improve with time and experience, and you can  always learn new skills that improve soft skills. People who are successful often  possess a variety of soft skills in the workplace. It has been argued that the  mastery of basic competency skills contributes to the degree of success  individuals attain.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You may have already completed another CTS course  where you learned about and practised applying basic competencies. If this is  the case, now is a good time for you to review the <a href="../inf1070_rub_bc.doc" target="_blank">Basic Competencies Rubric</a> and set new goals for improving your skills in  different areas. Check with your teacher about how to proceed for this part of  the course. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What do I need to do?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>brainstorm with  a partner (Your partner can be a friend or a family member.)</li>
    <li>compare ideas</li>
    <li>provide real-world,  personal examples</li>
    <li>apply and practise  the skills</li>
  </ul>
