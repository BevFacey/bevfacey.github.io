  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>   Project 1 will take approximately 1.5 hours. The information from this project  should be practised throughout the course.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv60x60"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_assesment_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Before you begin, print and review a copy of the <a href="../inf1070_rub_wkstn.doc" target="_blank">Workstation Routines  Rubric</a>.<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv60x60"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_direct_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For this course you will need to set up a central  location to store the documents you create. Watch the demonstration “<a href="../mm/inf_1070_002/inf_1070_002.htm" target="_blank">Creating a New  Folder and Subfolders</a>” to learn how to create folders for INF1070: Digital Presentation. This video is also available in the Toolkit. Check with your teacher as to where you will be saving your files.</p>
  <p><br />
  </p>
  <p>Create a folder called INF1070, and then create the  following subfolders within the INF1070 folder:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intro</li>
    <li>Presentations</li>
    <li>Final Project</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="icondiv60x60"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_direct_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Watch the  demonstration  “<a href="../mm/inf_1070_003/inf_1070_003.htm" target="_bl&ank">Opening PowerPoint for the First Time</a>” to learn how to open Microsoft PowerPoint® 2007. Make sure you save your work  in the course folder you created.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now, it’s  time to begin the project.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a new word processing document. Save the  file in the Intro folder and name it <em>Ergonomics</em>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv60x60"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_direct_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To review how to  open a word processing file, watch the demonstration “<a href="../mm/inf_1070_004/inf_1070_004.htm" target="_blank">Creating  and Saving a File</a>.”<br />
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step  2:</strong> Add a header and/or footer to your file  that includes your name, assignment name, and date. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv60x60"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_direct_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you are using Microsoft  Word®, watch the demonstration “<a href="../mm/inf_1070_005/inf_1070_005.htm" target="_blank">Headers  and Footers</a>” to review formatting headers and footers.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Using the Internet, the glossary, or a dictionary,  look up the word <em>ergonomics</em> and write a definition in your own words in the  word processing document. Save your Ergonomics document.</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="icondiv60x60"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_linkto_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now that you know  what ergonomics is, take some time to read the information in the <a href="inf1070_pr1_p2_01.html" target="_blank">Workstation  Ergonomics</a> document. Do you have anything to add to your  definition of ergonomics? If so, open  your document and make the changes. Then resave the document.<br />

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Watch the &quot;<a href="../mm/inf_1070_006/inf_1070_006.html" target="_blank">Ergonomics</a>&quot; video.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Study the following diagram on arranging a work  surface. It is important to ensure that you, too, have a clean, well-organized  area in which to work.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../images/graphics/inf1070_006_l.jpg" alt="Two illustrations showing how to arrange a work surface. The first arrangement shows a reference manual to the left of the keyboard, a document holder directly in front of the keyboard, and the computer monitor to the right of the document holder. The second arrangement shows only a computer monitor directly in front of the keyboard." width="633" height="360" /></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is your opportunity to improve your  computer workstation. Using the information and routines you have been given,  make appropriate adjustments to your furniture, equipment, and resources. If  you have access to a camera, take before and after pictures.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Answer the following questions in your Ergonomics document.</p>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>How many changes did you make?<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>What corrections were you not able to make  because of inadequate furniture, accessories, or lab restrictions?</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Open your Ergonomics document and insert  answers to the following questions: </p>
  <ol start="4">
    <li>What does practising good ergonomics and  setting up an efficient, safe, and organized workstation mean to you?<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>How can making this practice a habit help you  in the long run, both personally and as you enter into the workforce?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Resave your document.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="credit">© Juriah Mosin/shutterstock</p>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Make stretching a part of your routine. Practise  the exercises you have been shown every 30 minutes. Be sure to exercise your  shoulders, back, neck, wrists, fingers, and arms.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv60x60"><img src="../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_linkto_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong> Step 7:</strong> Read the  document <a href="inf1070_pr1_p2_02.html" target="_blank">Workstation  Security</a> for information regarding hardware and software  security and keeping your personal work secure.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ol start="6">
    <li>Answer  the following questions. You can use Internet search terms to perform some  research on these topics as well.
     <p>&nbsp;</p>  
      <ol type="a">
        <li>List three ways to protect your  equipment or secure your work.</li>
        <li>List three ways you can protect  your computer from viruses.</li>
      </ol>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
  <li>In  the Ergonomics document you created, comment on your areas of strength and  weakness. Set a goal to improve one or two areas you identified as needing  improvement. Here are a few examples of possible goals:
    <blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>I remember to  stretch every 30 minutes to help reduce muscle fatigue.</li>
      <li>I save files  frequently as I work and backup important files regularly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Using the <a href="../inf1070_rub_wkstn.doc" target="_blank">Workstations Routine Rubric</a>,  complete a <span class="nowrap">self-evaluation</span> to identify areas that you may need to work on  throughout the module. Revisit this rubric periodically throughout  the course, and self-evaluate your progress in making appropriate workstation  routines a daily habit.</p>
