  <p>Your slide show is complete with all the bells and  whistles, but before you publish or present your masterpiece, it is important to  find someone who will give you constructive feedback on your presentation. Collaborating  with a peer gives you a fresh pair of eyes to help with the final edits so  your presentation is flawless.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When your edits are complete, you are ready to present  or publish your presentation. But where is your audience located? Will you need to set up screens, projectors,  or perhaps additional monitors for a live presentation? Will you package your  presentation on a CD for easy transportation and distribution? Or will you perhaps  publish your presentation as a web page?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What will I learn  in Training Room 5?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Training Room 5 you will learn how to collaborate  on and deliver a presentation. Specifically, you will</p>
  <ul>
    <li>deliver  a slide show with rehearsed timings</li>
    <li>review  and proof your presentations and collaborate using comments</li>
    <li>secure  and share presentations</li>
    <li>prepare  printed materials</li>
    <li>package  and distribute a presentation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The  estimated completion time for Training Room 5 and Time to Practise 5 is three  hours.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>How can I improve  my learning?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To  really grasp what you are learning, you can</p>
  <ul>
    <li>read and watch demonstrations in Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 to discover how to work with visual content in a presentation<br />
      <br />
          </li>
    <li>use the Office Online Help and How-to website should you  require additional instruction or software assistance<br />
      <br />
          </li>
    <li>complete all practice activities to learn the software</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Ready to get  started?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Remember to complete all of Training Room 5, including all readings and  practice activities, before starting Time to Practise 5. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>From Training Room 5, you will be instructed to watch demonstrations in  the Project  3 Instructional Videos,  available in the Toolkit. You may want to open the following videos now so that they will be easily accessible to you as you complete the  training rooms.  </p>
