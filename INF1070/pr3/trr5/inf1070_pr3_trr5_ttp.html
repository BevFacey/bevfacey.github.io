  </h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Instructions</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now review your  Career Connections presentation by collaborating with a peer for a constructive  critique. Make any final edits necessary, and then prepare to package your  presentation. Discuss with your teacher how you will deliver your presentation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Use the Spelling command and review your  presentation to ensure your message is clear and complete. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Rehearse and save  timings.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Have a reviewer input  comments using the Review tab to make helpful suggestions to improve your presentation.  Incorporate the suggestions made by your reviewer in  the final editing of  the slide show. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Use the Document Inspector  to find and remove hidden information.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Save a copy of the presentation  to be compatible with earlier versions of PowerPoint; name the file &ldquo;Career  Compatible.&rdquo; Run the Compatibility Checker and make any necessary adjustments.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Print a copy of your Career  Connections presentation as Handouts, 6 slides per page. Add your name, INF1070  Digital presentation, and the date in a header on the handouts.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step  7: </strong>Use  the Office button to publish your  presentation. Package your  presentation in Copy to Folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 8: </strong>Discuss with your  teacher the preferred method of presentation delivery. </p>

  <h5>Checkpoint<br />
  </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your Career Connections PowerPoint  presentation should now be complete and ready to present. Ensure that you have  done the following tasks:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>made  final edits</li>
    <li>rehearsed  timings</li>
    <li>used  the Document Inspector</li>
    <li>prepared  your presentation to be packaged</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Retrieve the Software Skills Checklist that you saved to your computer. Check  off the skills you learned in this training room and that you are confident in  demonstrating. If needed, revisit Training Room 5 to review any of the skills  in which you had difficulties. Review any previous training rooms you feel  necessary. Don’t forget to resave your  Checklist.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now that you are finished all five of the training rooms, ensure that your work is saved, and then print a copy of the Project Assessment  Rubric, available in the Toolkit. Complete a self-assessment of your Career  Connections presentation. Make any final changes necessary to your  presentation. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Check in with your teacher to let your  teacher know you are done this portion of the course, and to ask what you should  do with your completed project and self-evaluation. The Project Assessment Rubric  is the same evaluation tool that will be used to assess your final project. So,  getting feedback from your teacher on your Career Connections project will help  you in completing your final project.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you feel comfortable demonstrating the skills  in this course, begin Project 4: Final Project.  </p>
