  <p>In the digital information age the power is yours to  instantly access information on any topic with the touch of a button. With  information so readily accessible, the challenge comes in communicating  information in a meaningful way to impact the intended audience. Therefore, learning  the art of successful communication is one of the most important skills you can  develop for life in the 21st century. A commonly used communication  tool is digital presentation software, and learning Microsoft Office PowerPoint&reg;  2007 makes it easier than ever to create powerful and professional  presentations that will engage your audience. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Digital presentations have many practical uses and  applications for a variety of different environments. They can be used to  support a presenter giving a live presentation, or they can be used to deliver  a self-running, auto-timed presentation like the kind you would see in a kiosk.  You can package presentations for distribution on a disc or publish your  presentation as a web page. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In schools, teachers use this technology as a teaching  tool, while students use digital presentations to show evidence of their learning.  In the workplace, businesses use presentations to train employees and share  critical information with customers and important stakeholders. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Developing skills using presentation software will  help you communicate information in an interesting and meaningful way; and  mastering the art of successful communication is a useful skill in all aspects  of your life.
