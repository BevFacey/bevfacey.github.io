  <h4>Time to Practise 2<br />
  </h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Training Room 1  you began a Career Connections PowerPoint  slide show profiling your personal inventory of skills, interests, and values  and making connections to three possible occupations. You entered the text from  your investigation into slides. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Having worked through Training Room 2, you now  know how to format the text and modify the layout of your slides. That’s  exactly what you’ll do in Time to Practise 2—you’ll format the text and modify  slide layouts in your Career Connections slide show to improve the look of your  slides.
  </p>

  </p>
  <h5>Instructions</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Open your Career Connections slide show  (named careers.pptx). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Format and modify the slides in your slide  show. Remember to </p>
        <ul>
          <li>format  the text ensuring the font size, type, and colour is readable <br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>limit  the amount of text you include on each slide by cutting and pasting information  to new slides as necessary<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>modify  and format text boxes as necessary<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>experiment  with bulleted and numbered lists<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>promote  and demote text as necessary<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>align  text and adjust the line spacing<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>save  changes as you go</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Resave your file.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="icondiv60x60"><img src="../../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_assesment_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <h5>Checkpoint<br />
        </h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The text  and slides in your Career Connections PowerPoint presentation should now be attractively  formatted and modified.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once you are finished Time to Practise 2 and  have saved your work, talk with your teacher regarding assessment. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Retrieve the Software Skills Checklist that you saved to your computer. Check  off the skills you have learned in this training room and that you are  confident in demonstrating. Don’t forget to resave your Checklist.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If needed, revisit Training Room 2 to review any  of the skills in which you had difficulties. If you are comfortable  demonstrating the skills presented in this training room, continue to Training Room  3. </p>
