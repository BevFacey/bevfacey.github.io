  <p>Researching and gathering the content for your  slides is the first step to creating your presentation. Building and formatting  your slides to convey information in a meaningful and appealing way is the next  step. In Training Room 1 you completed a career investigation and you built  your information into slides. Training Room 2 focuses on formatting and  manipulating your slides to improve the way they look. </p>
