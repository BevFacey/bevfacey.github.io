  <h3>Project 3: Digital Presentation Skills</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Time to Work</h5>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h5>Checking Your Work </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once you have completed each training room, complete  the Time to Practise exercise for that training room. The Time  to Practise exercises guide you towards creating a digital presentation from  start to finish. At the end of the training sessions you will have built,  collaborated, managed, and will deliver a presentation that explores careers  that fit with your values, interests, and skills.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Make sure you contact your teacher if you have questions about how to  work through this course, the content of the course, or how to complete any of  the work.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Use the <a href="../inf1070_skilllscheck.doc" target="_blank">Software Skills Checklist</a> to evaluate your level of understanding, and check off  skills you are able to demonstrate as you progress through the training rooms. It  is vital that you are competent in all software skills presented in the  training rooms before beginning the final project. Print or save a copy of the  software checklist now, so that you can refer to it as you work through the  training rooms. The checklist is also available in the Toolkit.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>You can repeat training  rooms and demonstrations as necessary if you encounter difficulties with the  software or with the Time to Practise exercises. You can also refer to the  Office Online Help and How-to website for software training and demonstrations.  You will learn more about this website in Training Room 1. If you experience any  road blocks, contact your teacher for help and support.</p>
