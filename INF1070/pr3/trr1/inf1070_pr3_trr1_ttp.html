  <p>At this stage in your  life, you may be starting to think about your future and the possible career  paths you wish to take. Knowing what you are good at and what you are  interested in goes a long way to helping you make career decisions. As you gain  more life experience and develop new skills, it is a good idea to assess your  career goals and possible career pathways. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For this activity you  will use the ALIS website to create or update a personal inventory  of your skills, interests, values, and attributes in order to make informed  connections to possible occupational choices. Communicate the findings of your  investigation by creating a PowerPoint presentation that you will use to practise  the skills you learn throughout the course.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this exercise you will apply all of the  knowledge and skills covered in Training Room 1. There are two parts to this  Time to Practise activity:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Part 1—Career Connections Investigation</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the ALIS website &ldquo;<a href="http://alis.alberta.ca/hs/cp/cpt/planning-tools.html" target="_blank">Self-Assessment Tools</a>.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Complete at least three of the ALIS self-assessment tools. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the search  tool on the ALIS website, find the  &ldquo;My Personal Inventory&rdquo; worksheet. Summarize  your findings using the worksheet.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Using the search  tool on the ALIS website, find &ldquo;OCCinfo&rdquo;  to view over 500 occupational profiles to match your personal inventory.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Choose three careers  that interest you. Print or summarize important information from the profile  sheet. You will use this information in Part 2 of this exercise.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Be sure to spend  some time exploring the ALIS website. There are a number of related activities  that are worthwhile to guide you on your career pathway.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>If you have already researched  careers in another Information Processing course, you can use your research  from that course for this activity. Locate your research from the other course,  and then revisit the ALIS website and explore different activities to reassess  and update your &ldquo;My Personal Inventory&rdquo; worksheet and career research. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Training  Room 2 teaches you how to copy and paste text. If you already know how to copy  and paste, you can copy and paste text from your document into the text  placeholders on the PowerPoint slides that you will create in Part 2 of this activity. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Part 2—Creating a  Basic Presentation</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once  you have information from your career connections investigation, you will  create a basic presentation that you will modify and enhance as you work  through the other training rooms of this course. In Time to Practise 1, you  will begin building a basic presentation by entering information from your  career investigation into the slides. Your presentation at this point should be  basic with no formatting or enhancements.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open PowerPoint and  create a Blank Presentation. Title your presentation &ldquo;Career Connections.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add slides to your  presentation that have the following information on them:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>outline  slide to provide an overview of the presentation <br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>personal  inventory slide to summarize your personal inventory results from the self-assessment  tools on the ALIS website and the “My Personal Inventory” worksheet<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>three  occupational profiles slides to profile three careers that interest you <br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>connections  slide to make connections from your personal inventory to your career choices; this  slide will address why you are interested in or suited to these careers<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>reflections  slide to communicate what you see as the positive and negative aspects of the  job<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>reference  slide to cite your source(s)<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>closing  slide to tie up your presentation</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Save the  presentation, naming the file &ldquo;career,&rdquo;  in your INF1070 folder.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="icondiv60x60"><img src="../../images/icons_blue_online/cts_b_assesment_l.jpg" width="58" height="58" /></div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Checkpoint<br />
  </h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Ask yourself the  following questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Can  I identify and navigate the PowerPoint 2007 screen and access commands in the  Ribbon and the Office button?</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Was  I able to create, enter data into, and save a new PowerPoint presentation to  document my findings from my career research?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you are finished Time to Practise 1 and  have saved your work, talk with your teacher regarding assessment. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Use the Software Skills Checklist, available in the Toolkit,<strong> </strong>to  check off the skills you have learned in this training room and that you are  confident in demonstrating. Remember to save the Checklist to your computer so  that you can keep it up-to-date.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If needed, revisit Training Room 1 to review any  of the skills in which you had difficulties. If you are comfortable  demonstrating the skills presented in this training room, continue to Training Room  2.</p>
