  <p><strong>What can you do with  PowerPoint?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>With Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 you can create effective and  professional-looking presentations complete with handouts, engaging training  sessions, memorable slide shows, and stunning photo albums. With PowerPoint  2007, it is quick and easy to create attention-grabbing presentations that combine  text, graphics, audio, and video. You can make your presentations even more professional  by adding charts, tables, diagrams, animations, special effects, and more. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Why use PowerPoint?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>PowerPoint is a powerful application in the Microsoft Office suite.  PowerPoint is designed to help you deliver digital presentations that will  engage and focus your audience. PowerPoint is simple to use, and it is easy to  get professional results.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What will I learn in  Training Room 1?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Training Room 1 you will learn</p>
  <ul>
    <li>about new features in PowerPoint 2007 </li>
    <li>how to build slides and enter text</li>
    <li>how to edit your presentation by adding and deleting  text and slides</li>
    <li>how to use different views to arrange your slides</li>
    <li>how to save your presentation to a folder</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The estimated completion time for Training Room 1 and  Time to Practise 1 is four hours. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>How can I improve my learning?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To really grasp  what you’re learning, you can</p>
  <ul>
    <li>read and watch demonstrations in Office  Online PowerPoint Help and How-to to discover some of the main features and general  skills for using PowerPoint (you’ll get more information on the Office Online  website in Training Room 1)<br />
      <br />
          </li>
    <li>complete the Time to Practise activities  to learn the software</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>When it’s time, how  do I get started building my presentation? </strong></p>
  <p><br />
    Before you begin creating your digital presentation, it is important to spend  some time planning and preparing. Doing so will keep you focused on your  objective as you build your presentation. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Determine the purpose of your presentation.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your presentation might be intended to </p>
  <ul>
    <li>train,  educate, or inform your audience</li>
    <li>report  findings from research</li>
    <li>persuade  your audience to take action</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Determine  what you want your audience to learn from your presentation. Ask yourself the  following questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the  point of my presentation?</li>
    <li>What message do  I want my audience to remember?</li>
    <li>Who is my  audience?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your audience might be any of the following or someone else entirely:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>students</li>
    <li>employees</li>
    <li>peers</li>
    <li>customers</li>
    <li>teacher</li>
    <li>boss</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Understanding your audience will help set the tone and the feel of your  presentation. Will your presentation be formal or informal, exciting or  informative, professional or humorous? Knowing your audience will determine how  you structure your presentation, because how you communicate with your peers is  different than how you communicate with your boss. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Ask yourself the following questions about your  audience:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What do they  already know about the topic? </li>
    <li>What is their  attitude or experience on the topic?</li>
    <li>What is the age  range of my audience?</li>
    <li>What are they  expecting from my presentation?</li>
    <li>What will keep  them interested in my presentation?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you  take time to consider these questions, you will be able to customize your  presentation to keep your audience engaged.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Set a timeline and estimate how long it will take you to do each of the  following. Then you’ll be ready to start completing each bullet. Before you  know it, you’ll have a presentation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Research and  gather information.<br />
      –
    Use credible sources.<br />
    –
    Properly cite ideas, quotations, facts, and surveys.<br />
    –
    Develop and conduct your own surveys, interviews,  questionnaires, or experiments.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li>Create your  presentation.<br />
  –
    Enter and format information onto slides.
    <ul>
      <li>Develop a strong opening to introduce your topic. </li>
      <li>Build slides to support your ideas. </li>
      <li>Limit the amount of text per slide; be clear and to  the point. </li>
      <li>Keep your audience’s interest level and attention  span in mind.</li>
      <li>Wrap up your presentation with a closing slide that  reinforces your message.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
    </ul>
      –
        Enhance your Presentation.
        <ul>
          <li>Add graphics, charts, and multimedia.</li>
          <li>Include links, effects, and animation.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    <li>Collaborate and  present the presentation.<br />
    – Review your presentation, checking for errors and  omissions.<br />
    – Request a constructive review of your presentation.<br />
    – Review the flow of ideas and organize slides for  delivery.<br />
    – Rehearse timings for an auto-run presentation that  isn&rsquo;t too fast or too slow.<br />
    – Prepare speaker and presentation handouts.<br />
    –
    Prepare to present and publish the presentation,  including practising using presentation equipment on location, if possible.</li>
  </ul>
    <p><strong>How do I make my presentation professional?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Follow these  tips for creating a professional slide show:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Format text consistently on each slide by limiting  the number of fonts, sizes, and styles.<br />
      <br />
          </li>
    <li>Apply coordinated and consistent colour and  formatting schemes to text and background, and choose fonts (and size), colour, and  background colours that are easy for your audience to read.<br />
      <br />
          </li>
    <li>Insert graphics, tables, charts, or video to support  or clarify your message.<br />
      <br />
          </li>
    <li>Use animations to highlight information on slides. <br />
      <br />
          </li>
    <li>Apply transitions between slides.<br />
      <br />
          </li>
    <li>Use special effects sparingly, thoughtfully, and  consistently for the greatest impact—too many or random effects can be distracting. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>From this  point on you will do the bulk of your work in Microsoft PowerPoint 2007. Each training  room is set up in a PowerPoint presentation. From each training room, you will  be instructed to watch demonstrations. These demonstrations are also available in the Toolkit. You may want to open the  following videos  now so that they will be easily accessible to  you as you complete the training rooms.  </p>
