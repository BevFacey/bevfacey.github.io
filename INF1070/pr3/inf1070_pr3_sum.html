  <h3>Project 3: Digital Presentation Skills</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Project 3 Summary</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Through your experiences in the training rooms and  the Time to Practise exercises you will have developed a custom presentation  demonstrating your skills in creating, formatting, working with visual content,  and adding links and effects. You will also have explored opportunities for  collaboration and discussed methods of presentation delivery with your teacher.  Think of how you will use your digital presentation skills in your personal  life, in your other school subjects, and as you enter post-secondary or the  workforce. People with skills stand out. Are you one of those people?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you are confident that you are competent in the  skills presented in the training rooms and have demonstrated competency in the  Time to Practise exercises, you are ready to move onto your final project.  Remember, if you have any difficulties with the final project you can return to  the training rooms for review.</p>
