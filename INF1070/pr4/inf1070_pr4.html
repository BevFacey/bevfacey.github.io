  <p>Before beginning the Final Project, make sure  that you are confident in demonstrating all the skills on the Software Skills Checklist  to determine your readiness for final evaluation. Complete the Time to Reflect  portion of the Checklist, and then submit your completed Checklist to your  teacher.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You have  learned important skills using presentation software, and now it is time to  demonstrate your skills by preparing your own presentation for final  assessment. Keep in mind that you may use this final project to begin building  a professional portfolio of your work to show potential employers or  post-secondary institutions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Refer to the Project  Assessment Rubric, available in the Toolkit, for the grading criteria for this  project. It should take you approximately 7–10 hours to complete your Final  Project.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What do I already know?</strong></p>
  <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
  <p>By completing the five training rooms and Time to Practise activities, you  have learned the necessary content and software skills to complete the Final Project.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>What do I need to do?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You will create, manage, deliver, and publish a  digital presentation of 15–30 slides that includes the following components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>text, data, graphics, and background </li>
    <li>audio and video media clips </li>
    <li>a table or chart </li>
    <li>animations and transitions </li>
    <li>timings </li>
    <li>hyperlinks or action buttons </li>
    <li>handouts printed with six  slides per page </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Experiment with templates, themes, and master slides  as you build your project, and collaborate with a partner for feedback as you  get to the final stages.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you’ve finalized your presentation, save a copy  of your file as a Portable Document Format (.pdf) and discuss your presentation  delivery options and expectations with your teacher.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h5>Project Topic Options</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Select one of the following options  for the focus of your final project:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Almost all people have individual interests, hobbies,  pursuits, hopes, and passions. Create your Final Project on any topic that interests  you.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>A self-running, auto-timed  slide show can be used to create advertising like a commercial or an infomercial.  Create a slide show to advertise a product or service you know very well and  like very much. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Discuss your idea with your teacher before getting to work.  You must receive approval from your teacher before beginning your Final  Project.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Use the <a href="inf1070_pr4_01.doc" target="_blank">Presentation  Planning Worksheet</a> to help you  plan your presentation. Your teacher may want to see your completed Worksheet before  you begin creating your Final Project or when you submit your Final Project.</p>
