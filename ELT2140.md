# ELT2140: Robotics 2

Students demonstrate the fundamental concepts of sensor devices and control systems by building an electronic circuit to control a direct wire or mobile robot.

## Theory

In a document, slide deck, video, or other (approved) medium, answer the following:

1. Sensor Principles: Explain the physical and electronic principles behind the operation of photoelectric, sound, tactile, proximity, and thermal sensors.
2. System Architecture: Using a block diagram, illustrate and explain the different functional "blocks" of a sensor control system.
3. Subsystem Comparison: What are the primary differences among drive systems, sensor control systems, and processing systems?.
4. Logic & Feedback: Describe the fundamentals of how a control system operates the motor drives within a robotic unit.
5. Industrial Analysis: Research and describe two specific examples of where industry currently utilizes sensory control robots.
6. Device Evaluation: Compare at least three different sensory devices and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using each in a mobile robotics application.
7. Safety & Protection: Explain the importance of circuit protection devices, such as fusing and temperature cutoffs, and why robots must operate within specific design tolerances.

## Practical

### Sensor Control Build

* Select one sensor type (photoelectric, sound, tactile, proximity, or thermal) and assemble the necessary electronic components to build a functional sensor unit.
* Draw a detailed schematic diagram of your sensor control circuit.

### Direct-Drive Prototype

* Prototype a sensory control system and construct a circuit where the sensor directly controls the motors.
* Mount your sensor control unit onto a mobile or direct-wire robot.

### Portfolio

* Demonstrate the capabilities of your robotic system, ensuring it functions according to its intended sensory-drive logic.
* Write a technical report that describes the control system's operation and includes your diagrams and troubleshooting notes.
* Identify possible life roles or occupations related to the skills learned in this module and analyze the opportunities available in your immediate environment.
